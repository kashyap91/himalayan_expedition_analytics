JOM Roberts - 3 Nov 1969

West Ridge of Annapurna II: waxy ridge, series of snow towers.
Up to summit of C4 for observation and radio contact.
Annapurna IV just a feature south of West Ridge of Annapurna II.

Kondo, Ogawa and Sakashita tried to reach summit. Very late, so 2 members stayed in biv and only Kondo to summit about 8:30 pm.

7300m on West Ridge.

Left C5 6:00 am on 6 May, reached biv site at 12:00. Attack time very short, so Ogawa stayed there and other 2 went on. Leader on walkie-talkie at 5 pm told them to come back ""so I came back but Mr. Kondo cannot hear so went on"" (Sakashita and Kondo had separated because Sakashita had returned to biv for flag). Sakashita at 7650m at 5 pm and returned to biv. Kondo returned to biv site at 11:00 pm. Enough moonlight for Kondo to see to climb. Kondo had no flag with him. 

Only one summit attempt via West Ridge route as planned.

No accidents, illness, frostbite, or yeti.

Route now very difficult but very long; ridge snow until summit ridge of mixed snow and rock on which rope not necessary.

Alan's illness never cleared up but all got onto plateau at about 21,000 feet which meant all technical difficulties over, but summit 5 miles away. Got onto West Ridge from valley where mountian school is decided against North Face when 3 massive avalanches came down when at ABC (dust of one hit camp), so went for repeat of Chris Bonington ridge route.

Snow every day, which meant tracks made to move loads high were filled in after night sleeping low.

Wind prevented summit attempt; got to 22,500 feet and then Alan couldn't go down above because no fixed rope.

Adrian and Moores tried to go to top on 18 Oct but so windy couldn't get beyond 23,500 that day and then quit.

C4 highest point reached by 5 members and 1 Sherpa (not Hirata, who not so well); they staged 25 April in C4.

Tanabe and Nozaki met in good condition 26 April and descended with Nishikawa that day; going to C3 and planned Doi, Inoue and 1 Sherpa next day to C5.

Tanabe fell at 6700m on 26 April during descent; was sick and slipped; was jumaring down fixed rope, but then at traverse slipped and fell 10m on 60 degree slope and injured. 

Nishikawa made biv for Tanabe, but now Nishikawa had bad headache. Tanabe died at 8:00 pm of exhaustion and exposure and perhaps altitude sickness.

27 April - Nishikawa thought Tanabe sleeping, but finds early am he dead and now decides Tanabe died evening before. Nishikawa goes up to C4, those in C4 then descend. All reached BC with body 30 April.

1 May - body cremated at BC; ash and bones placed under Cwm with stones saying Tanabe sleep here and date. Inoue takes some bone to family in Japan.

Made one camp in direction of Southeast Spur, but those in this team Michalski and Pankiewicz decided that with equipment and difficulties and weather, this route not possible, too much danger of avalanche. Returned after 2 days after having been to 6000m on spur.

Next Kintopp, Laskowski and Michalski tried left across glacier and then up to make C3, on south side of West Ridge. This 1st attempt on West Ridge from South.

Pankiewicz and Grochowski made ascent to Col with some difficult ice; made C4 and next day they tried to go up the ridge but returned because snow, wind and cold; went only about 200m up Ridge and then to C2.

Kintopf and Laskowski tried to go to C4, but just about 100m from tent snow avalanche came and they fell about 400m down (about 700m distance). Both alive but Laskowski knee injured and Kintopf head cut and both mentally confused at first.

So it was clear not possible to try for summit because had to help Kintopf and Laskowski who had to be escorted down and route very dangerous; southern approach to Annapurna II very dangerous.

Another avalanche accident between BC and ABC when Laskowski also fell, this time fell 200-300m to glacier.

Above C1 some big technical difficulties in rocky barrier about 200m high and needed fixed rope.

Letter of 20 Sept at ABC from Ang Karma:

We spent 10 days in all at C1 waiting for good weather and taking loads up to the col - C2. On the way there, there is a short section of fixed rope and one evening Lincoln Hall pulled same rocks down on him as the rope was badly placed. The rocks broke his helmet and badly bruised his arm and foot so that he could not walk for a week.

A few days ago we finally made it up to the col: Andy, Greg, Lincoln, Tenzing, Narayan; Mike returned to base because he had some infection.

The attempt was now abandoned: they needed rest and better shelter, they did not want to move through the icefall more than once, very strong cold winds threatened them with frostbite, there were no good bivouac sites on the face, and the mountain was very dangerous.

Leader Gordon Smith commented that the success of the Canadian Annapurna IV team demonstrated the strength of a well united team of mountaineers prepared to work together for a common goal and hoped that this combination would be utilized in next years Canadian attempt on Mountain Everest.

The expedition started from Kathmandu on November 6th with a day's journey by bus to the village of Dumre. From Dumre the group started walking up the Marshyangdi River valley with all their equipment and food carried by 110 porters.

On November 13th, after 7 days walking the village of Chame at 9000 ft. was reached in an unreasonably early and heavy snowfall. As most porters were unshod they abanodned the group and returned to warmer climes.

Twenty stalwart porters remained and along with the aid of horses and yaks hired locally the expedition continued for several days up the valley past the village of Ingre until the side valley leading to Annapurna IV was reached.

Several days of ferrying loads of 70 lbs up the glacial morraines resulted in the establishing of base camp at 15,700 ft by Nov 26th.

Local regulations did not permit the climb to start until the beginning of the official winter season on Dec 1. On that date the team started breaking trail through deep snow on the lower slopes.

Adrian Burgess was in front and accidentally started a slab avalanche which, to everyone's amazement he outran, indicating an incredible level of fitness at that altitude.

Fixed ropes were placed up the rocks and snow of the 1st buttress and by Dec 5th the ice cave which was Camp I was established at 18,700 ft. From here further ropes were fixed through tumbling ice cliffs to the site of Camp II at 20,000 ft.

At this point a tent was placed temporarily to shelter expedition memebers while they dug the Camp II ice cave.

On December 7th a severe snow storm with gale force winds hit the Annapurna range. This resulted in the route being obliterated by the fresh snow. The next day the following high winds ripped apart and blew away the C2 tent in a 80-100 mph gust. Left without shelter the two members who were digging C2 were forced to descend. This event reaffirmed the team's conviction that, as in Canada, the only sure way to weather a severe winter storm was to live in ice caves.

The next two days were spent re-establishing the route from base to C2. Working from C1 two Sherpas, Sona Gyau and Dawa Dorje managed to complete the excavation of C2 by Dec 14th, allowing members to stock it with food and equipment.

Once C2 was established progress was rapid and the Burgess twins together with Marshall and Langley fixed rope through the crevasses at the rim of the summit ridge maing the route safe to the site of C3 1 km along the 4 km ridge. The digging of C3 was completed by Dec 1th however it required 3 more days of carrying loads to supply the camp with food, survival and climbing equipment.

After returning to base camp for a few days rest the 1st summit party left base camp early on Dec 20th and moving rapidly up the fixed ropes were ensconced in C3 by the night of Dec 2/12
Ready for the summit attempt.

It is appropriate that Roger Marshall should be a member of the first party to reach the summit as he instigated the 1982 Canadian Mt Everest Expedition 6 years ago


Canadian Mount Everest Society Report 1981/82

At the end of October 1981, the 1981 Canadian Winter Annapurna IV Expedition left Canada bound for Kathmandu, Nepal, to attempt to make the first winter ascent of Annapurna IV via the northwest buttress. The team was led by Gordon Smith, and consisted of Roger Marshall, twins Alan and Adrian Burges, Carl Hannigan, Steve Langley, Don Serl and Jay Straith.

Leaving Kathmandu on November 6, 1981, with 5 Sherpa  porters, 1 government liasion officer and 105 local porters to carry the 3000 kilos of food and equipment, the expedition travelled in two buses to the small town of Dumre, a distance of only 120 kms, but taking most of one day to cover. The Marshyangdi Khola valley was then followed for 7 days to the town of Chame where shelter was taken for three days during an unseasonably early winter storm. At this point, 75 of the local porter left, not relishing the thought of wading through wet snow in bare feet and clad only in a blanket. Eventually the equipment was moved up the Base Camp valley using yaks and the few hardy porters who had remained. On November 23rd, Base Camp was occupied at 4660 metres and the rest of the month spent tramping out a trail across the glacier to the foot of the northwest buttress.

December 1st saw the start of the official winter climbing season in Nepal, and hectic activity on the lower part of the mountain. Camp I was occupied by the Burgess twins on December 3rd and C2 on December 6th by Marshall and Smith. A snowstorm the following day forestalled the digging of a permanent ice-cave at this site. Eventually, the gale force wind blew away the C2 tent and a decision was reached not to use any further tents during the climb. From this point, all camps were located in ice-caves dug into the mountain side. Finally, on December 12 & 13th, the cave at C2 was completed and ready for use.

During the next week, the twins, Marshall and Langley established, C3 at 6416m while Smith, Hannigan, Serl, Straith and the two Sherpas stocked all the ice-caves with food and equipment ready for an attempt to reach the summit. Finally, on December 22nd (the shortest day of the year), Al and Ad Burgess and Roger Marshall reached the summit of Annapurna IV climbing an incredible 1109 metres vertical height in a single day from C3. The whole trip up and down from the top ice-cave was accomplished in daylight, despite wind gusts up to 100 kmph and a Camp III starting temperature of -30 degree C.

A second summit bid on December 26th, by Smith, Langley and the Sherpa Sirdar was abandoned shortly below the summit due to increasingly severe winds. All the camps were cleared on the descent and Base Camp evacuated on December 28th. By January 2, 1982 all the team was back in Kathmandu, having climbed the highest mountain in the world to date during the official Nepalese winter climbing season of December-January.

Only 5 to summit because 2 members had became ill from diarrhea and went down while Trueman dropped down to control the climb. A member was in summit party but turned back soon after leaving C5 with suspected cerebral edema (and who developed frostbite) and stayed at C5 till others could evacuate him and 2 members stayed with them. Dunn's hands so frostbitten during summit success that he couldn't use them (his nose also frostbitten, it may have to have plastic surgery and he may lose tops of 2 fingers). So now no strength for any attempt on Annapurna II. Had 3-day job getting people in C1 off the mountain.

Annapurna IV is totally different from 30 years ago; ice cliffs totally different and tons of ice must have broken away. All this change between C2 and C4 (C4 was 1960's C3). Technical difficulties were these cliff and crevasses which had to be fixed, and huge crevasse system opened above C4 which was not fixed but where had to be careful.

Snowed often and snow conditions also helped exhaust team, as did technical problems. Probably should have had high-altitude Sherpas to carry loads.

Trueman reported the mountain was totally different from what his research had shown it to be 30 years ago. Ice cliffs were very different: tons of ice must have broken away causing realignment of the cliffs and creating big crevasses. All this changed between his team's C2 at 5400m and his C4 at 6484m, which had been the site for C3 in 1960. The technical difficulties were these cliffs and crevasses between C2 and C4 which had to be fixed with rope, and a huge crevasses system above C4 which was not fixed but where great care was needed. Because of technical problems, he felt the team probably should have employed high-altitude Sherpas to carry supply loads and save members' strength for the planned attempt on Annapurna II which was not made.


British Joint Serives Annapurna II and IV Expedition 1992
Taken from Himalaya Club Newsletter 1993

The British Joint Services Expedition Annapurna 2 and 4 1992, led by Major Mike Trueman 10th Gorkha Rifles, arrived at Lower Base Camp on 31 March 1992 after a one week approach march from the road-head at Besi Sahar. Conditions on arrival were poor and the team were plagued by bad weather throughout the climb. Advance BC (4800m) was established on 3 April after a concerted effort by the team and 4 porters.

The route to the summits followed the prominent ridge to a feature known as the Dome (6300m), between Annapurnas 3 and 4. This gained the main shoulder of Annapurna 4 which in turn led to the to the equally long knife edge leading to Annapurna 2.

From our research, supported by the sirdar who had been on the mountain 10 years before. It was apparent that the features of the mountain had changed significantly: Large cliffs and sizeable crevasse fields had formed as large chunks of the mountain had given way. This presumably accounted for the high failure rate of expeditions during the previous decade.

Camp I (5100m) was established on 7th April on an obvious promontory, and C2 quickly followed on 10 April. This was the start of the maind difficulties of the climb and it took a further 10 days to force the route to camp 3 on 20 April.

Weather conditions were continuing to take their toll on load carrying members and lead climbers, and a particularly heavy snowfall on 23 April forced the team off the mountain for 3 days.

On 3 May, 3 pairs of climbers set off and established an assault camp at 7000m. Later that day a storm closed in and forced all those on the mountain to remain in their tents for 48 hours. Mike Trueman reported 2m of snow had fallen at C4 and the summit attempt was again in doubt. However a fine spell followed and 5 members of the team, Brian Tilley, Mark Samuels, Rod Runn, Steve Wilson and Glyn Sheperd reached the summit on 5th May.

The retreat became a 72-hour epic.

Batard, the only foreigner in his party, had four Nepalis help him make camps in snow caves at 6550m & 7350m on the West Pillar, and to fix 2000m of rope along the pillar from 6000 to 7750m, ending at the last major difficulty. Now tired, Batard descended to BC for a day's rest, then began a solo push for the summit; he left his second cave at 2:30 am on 27th April & was on the top at 9:45 am despite some difficulty with a 50m rock step at 8000m and 100km/hr winds. He descended the normal route in the first traverse of Makalu, found an Italian team's tent at the Makalu La which reassured him he was on the right line, continued down to another empty Italian tent, where he slept the night, then joined Germans at base for breakfast.

Fixed 200m rope: from 6000m to 7750m; finished rope fixing 24 April at last difficult point. Slept in C2 hoping to go to top on 25th but too tired so down to BC that day. Started up again 2:00 pm 26th and spent an hour at German-Swiss BC and on to start of Pillar at 5900m, where arrived middle of night and slept 2 hours. 27th started 2:30 am up and reached top at 9:45 am; main difficulties end at 7750m but at 8000m is a rock step of 50m which was 4 degree difficulty (i.e., not great difficulty). Above this easy terrain but wind of 100 km/hr sometimes before reaching rock step at about 8:00 am. Stayed at summit 5-6 minutes and found big oxygen bottles (yellow) and left red flag on which wrote his name, date and time tied to oxygen bottle. Descended via a small couloir to Makalu Col, where Italians had a tent; was very very happy to see tent because feared he was lost; reached empty tent at 2:15 pm and on to Italians and Germans: empty C2 at 7000m; stayed in an Italian tent and slept till 28th morning because very tired and light snowfall that night. Left tent and followed Italian flags from early morning and arrive German BC at glacier junction at 9:00 am. Ate with Germans and then with Italians left. No frostbite or illness; face sunburned while descending couloir and from Col under hot sun and with ice in his short beard.

Ongel Sherpa and Iman Gurung carried ropes for Batard to fix - carried to 7500m and Gurung climbed to 7750m on 24th. Then they down to BC and Ongel up with Batard on 26th to 5900m only.

Batard saw no other person on mountain from his departure from depot on 26th till he arrived at Germans and Italians BC on 28th morning. No Germans or Italians were in their higher camps when he came down through them. (He used an Italian sleeping bag to sleep in 27th night because he had no bag with him.)

Happy about his success? ""very nice"". Was sure he would reach summit alone when he left Ongel at 5900m: ""I like to climb rock and I know at altitude I can climb quickly. ""I was very sure when I had put up C1 and C2 and it was not difficult for me.""


Batard - 14 June 88

Batard considers his climb of Makalu last month a solo ascent because he climbed this mountain all alone after having fixed ropes with helpers and descended with them to BC.


Messner & Joos - 16 May 88

Batard's ascent of Makalu: First traverse of Makalu but it is not a solo ascent when others climbed with him preparing the route and he descended a prepared route. ""A great thing anyway - my congratulations to him"" says Joos. ""He is very strong."" ""It was the first traverse of Makalu and in a very good style"" says Messner, but not a solo climb.


Carlos Buhler - 17 May 88

""I'm impressed - very much impressed"" if he really went up West Pillar as Batard says he did - an extremely difficult route.


Loretan - 5 May 88

Marc Batard's ascent of Makalu this spring was not a solo ascent - had had help fixing rope and pitching camps.


Hupfauers - 29 May 88 (Makalu)

Mrs Hupfauer saw Batard up Pillar to 6000m then clouds obscured view. Sure he went to Pillar, where had fixed ropes. Next seen when he descended to Germans BC. Not a solo ascent.


From Tourism Minishtry, 2 May 88
Re: Report of Makalu I by Marc Batard

I left the BC on April 26th at 2 pm and I stopped for one hour at the BC of the German/Swiss Expeditions. I reached my C2 (altitude 7350m) at midnight I slept for two hours and left for the assault at 2 am. I reached the top at 7:45 am on April 27th. I stayed at the summit for 15 minutes. I planted a flag (in a simple piece of red cloth) after having written on it my name date and hour. I fixed this flag at the top of an oxygen bottle which was empty and lying there.

The weather started to be rough and the descent was therefore made painful although I had to decide to follow the normal route. During my descent the very strong wind persisted and I reached C2 of the German/Swiss & Italian expeditions (altitude 7000m approx) at 3 pm. This camp was empty I took the liberty in going to sleep in one of the 3 tents and left the sleeping bag inside which I had used.

On 28th April I left this camp in the early morning to reach the German/Swiss & Italian BC at 9 am approx. I had a very cordial [reception] there and left after lunch at around 1 pm. Two hours later I reached my own BC and I was happy to meet again all 5 members of my staff.

I left my BC on 29th April at 6 am and arrived at Tashigaon at 7 pm the same day (a long walk). Again on 30th I left that place on 6 am to reach Tumlingtar approx at 8 pm the same day. During [at?] Khandbari I met the liaison officer whom I told that I had reached the summit succesfully on April 27th.

A very challenging climb: Habeler said it the hardest climb he's ever done. Very long route by way of ridge near Col. Hit by big snowstorm night of 3rd which turned into epic descent. Habeler on top 9:30 am whereas other 2 at 2:00 pm after all having left C4 together at 4:00 am. Habeler very quick at altitude, got back to C4: Habeler about noon or 1:00 pm other 2 at 9:00 pm. Snowstorm started 10:00 am that day; it was obvious weather was changing. Scott 1979 route from N Ridge, Messner's route to ridge. Storm of 3 and 4 May dropped meter of snow and took out C2 and C3, hit Sherpas in C3, who took 12 hours to C1 (1-1/2 to 2 hour trip normally) without crampons. Summiters slept 3 May in C4, took camp down and put it up again at C3 site. On 5th summiters left everything knowing must get to C1 in severe avalanche conditions and end of their strength. Martin descended behind other 2. Final section on ridge was very tricky with windslab. Both Habeler and Zabaleta had bad pneumonia and high fevers when reached C1-BC on 6th May but no frostbite. Buhler's toes frozen on summit but will not lose any bone. Timing was lucky: if had gone to C3 on 3rd, would have been swept off: if had tried for top one day later would never have made summit and would not have been able to get off the mountains stranded as on K2 in 1986.

Habeler - 22 May 1988: Note pneumonia. Habeler's problem probably spindrift snow in lungs; Zabaleta very bad sore throat. Habeler left Austria and Lufthansa flags at summit tied to an aluminum pole.

Note: February 2012

Carlos Buhler says that oxygen was used at BC by Habeler and Zabaleta the next day after descending from the summit [to treat pnuemonia resulting from the climb]. Original notes by Hawley state that oxygen was used by Habeler and Zabaleta on descent at C1 because of pneumonia and again by Habeler at BC.


1988 International Kangchenjunga Expedition Report by Carlos Buhler

Kangchenjunga's North Face rises two vertical miles in one sweep of overlapping cliffs, rock faces and hanging glaciers. It is a masterpiece of nature's architecture, designed to discourage climbers from attempting to reach the summit from this side. Although technically possible routes exist, every conceivable line at some point is exposed to serious rockfall, falling ice or avalanches.

Our 15 day appraoch to BC went smoothly. As the approach to this area had been closed to all but climbing expeditions, the encroachment of Western civilization had been minimal and the villages were unchanged by modern tourism.

We established BC on April 3 at Pangpema, a tranquil, pastoral field alongside the Kangchenjunga Glacier. Over the next three weeks, the weather permitted only three constructive trips beyond this 5000 meter camp. During short good weather spells, we placed C1 and and C2 at 5800m and 6400m. Towards the end of April, a ferocious storm confined us to BC for six days. Late on the 26th, the weather finally cleared. Peter, Martin and I, accompanied by Nima and Dawa, our two Sherpa companions, set out for C1 early the next morning. We wondered how long the good weather would last. On the 28th, we climed through the dangerous ice cliffs and continued to C2. With the help of the Basques, who came up a day behind us, we spent April 29 and 30 climbing and fixing 300m of 7mm rope on the steep ice and rock flanks leading to the north ridge.

On May 1, we carried all our equipment for the next five days. We climbed and fixed the remaining 200m face and continued, unroped, up the exposed north ridge to sleep at 7150m. The next day, we fixed a final 100m through the rock step at 7300m and carried on to 7450m on the huge plateau below the summit pyramid. Nima and Dawa then descended to C2 the same afternoon. That night there were signs that the good weather was ending. The winds that had been coming steadily from the east began to blow again from the southwest.

Nevertheless, at four am on May 3, we left for the summit in frigid darkness. We reached the rock walls of the vast summit cone as dawn was breaking. Though together at first, each of us now climbed alone in a private world of struggle. I went through a tremendous range of emotion. At times I found myself elated to be so near the summit of such a huge mountain. Then I became utterly discouraged at the situation in front of me. I was frightened by the steepness, by the intense cold drilling into me and, most of all, by the descent that would have to follow. There seemed to be so many places that I could make a fatal mistake. Waves of anxiety swept over me. I could only break away from them when I pushed on with the intense activity of climbing. I passed a tattered, frozen in rope that the 1980 Japanese expedition must have placed over the short rock steps. I recalled their placing 250m of line through the gully to safeguard their descent. I felt insecure and exposed. After the rock step I stopped and removed the 20m coil of 6 mm line I had been carrying. It seemed absurd to lug it further as Martin and Peter were both above me. I did the same with my open spare mitten. I wanted to leave behind every ounce I could. Only water, a small piece of sausage and my short ice axe remained in my rucksack.

Peter called upon all his strength and set a fantastic pace. He reached the summit at 9:30 am. Martin and I were still four and half hours away. As we feared, at ten am snow began to fall and visibility dwindled. We crossed paths with Peter at 10:30 while the snow fell steadily. All three of us discussed options on the steep ramps of snow. ""Ahora o nunca!"" we decided. Now or never! It was unlikely that Martin and I would ever be this close again.

We climbed the final, delicate 100m of the West Ridge in the growing storm. There was no view at all. The terrain was steep and unforgiving. We followed endless traverses around granite buttresses, up 50-degree snow slopes and into windy corners. The blowing nearly blinded us as it built up inside our goggles. At two pm, I climbed over a broken, blocky step to the summit, too cold to feel elation. I took ten quick photographs at different apertures as Martin came up the last several meters. After 30 seconds, we started down. A half-buried oxygen bottle a few meters from the top reminded me of what I needed most.

We were desperate to get out of the wind that tore across from the south. As soon as we dropped below the ridge and onto the North Face, I asked Martin to stop and help warm my feet. Then we continued on. The descent from the summit to our tent at 7450m took us seven hours in the heavily falling snow.

At nine pm we caught sight of the lit up dome of the tent through the swirling winds. In a few minutes we were pulling off our frozen boots between bouts of hacking coughs. Peter radioed to BC of our arrival and helped us prepare a hot drink. The relief we felt was indescribable, but it was not to last long. All night it kept on snowing.

Nearly a meter of snow had fallen by the next morning when we resumed the descent. Laden with gear from the camp, we plowed across the broad, exhausting plateau. 

At six Am leaving everything but film and cameras, we began the treacherous and terrifying descent over the snow caked slabs of the north ridge. Traversing and down climbing, we wove our way through the unstable windslabs. Doubt and uncertainty dogged every step. We were at the mercy of the gods. We were asking too much.

After an eternity, we reached the fixed ropes leading down the icy flanks towards C2. Below them, we had to fight our way across hundreds of meters of knee-deep snow before the next blow. The well stocked tents of C2 had also been swept away! Without recourse, we struggled down the dangerous slopes towards C1. On the glacier at 6000m we managed only short distances before collapsing in the snow to regain strength. This was the most gruelling test of endurance any of us had ever experienced.

Lhakpa met us just above C1 with water and the news that Nima and Dawa had been seriously injured when their tent at C2 had been swept 300m down the face by two consecutive snow slides on the night of May 3. Though they had survived the fall, they spent twelve hours fighting their way down without equipment, both with broken ribs. Dawa had suffered so severe a concussion that he had no realization that he was on a mountain and believed he was in a lowland village. He had not eaten or drunk substanially in forty hours. They were still in C1, unable to gather the strength to return to BC.

On May 6, nine days after setting off, a weak and battered crew staggered into the cheering voices and comforting hugs of friends in BC. The Basques had seen the storm coming on May 3 as they neared their final biv at 7450m and had descended to safety the same day. Although they made two further attempts, neither they nor the Indian expedition on the southwest side managed to reach the summit. Tragically, the deputy leader of the Indians died, supporting a bid for the top in late May.

We came away from our success with humility coupled with deep satisfaction. In an endeavour where boldness and commitment are highly rewarded, we asked ourselves, to what extent could the hazards be ultimately controlled?",2 Sherpas broke ribs when avalanche hit C2 on night of May 3; Buhler frostbite; Habeler and Zabaleta illness,1st American ascent,Mountain Travel,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453233,

2nd summit party reached Col between Yalung Kang and main summit (to col after realized could not get all the way to top). 2nd party turned back from Col after reaching their new goal at 8450m, which had been set when frostbite would preclude ascent to summit. Kolwankar's feet especially bad.

Stayed at BC with virus infection for few days. 15th made bivouac at 4800m, a walk from BC, then from there tried NE Ridge; they weren't well acclimatized and descended; back at BC 17th April. Decided to put camp not far from biv site and it was pitched on 19th at about 4800m. Another attempt on NE Ridge on 20 April by same 2 men and reached subsidiary summit and took 3 days to do so in series of 3 bivs on ridge to 6300m North summit before descending safely to BC 24 April. 

Other 3 climbers then moved up from BC on 26 April and gave face a day to clear of avalanches and on up on 27th evening to a biv at about 17,000 ft and at midnight 27/28 and reached 19,000 ft, where one Czech unwell and all turned back. Were on N Face. Now Czechs had to go home, so climbing finished.

3 climbing members climbed together the whole time; twice ""walked"" up to 7600m from C4 and twice dropped back to C4: first day to have a look at terrain and 2nd because had no food with them from C4 (porters had been expected to carry up food and equipment from C3 to C4 to final camp to be established but they never appeared) and no equipment for E Summit camp and summit push. Very little food and fuel in C4 by now, so called off the climb. Stayed in C4 2 nights hoping Sherpas would come but they did not: said 1000 Chinese soldiers were in area and coming to seize expeditions; were afraid of Chinese and had dismantled ABC. All 6 Sherpas complained of headache and stomach trouble but same day dismantled 2 camps. Sirdar was incompetent as leader of men and another Sherpa, Mingma Norbu of Kharikhola wasn't knowledgeable of Cho Oyu, knew nothing and organized retreat of Sherpas.

Had permit for SW Ridge and went up Summa glacier to have look at but rock wall above 7000m looked too difficult as an approach; so crossed col to west and made new base at normal BC site below Nangpa La. 30 Apr two climbers [Sterritt and Morris] set out from C4 with Walsh; Sterrit reached very little higher before altitude sickness sent him back to C4; Morris went on 200-300m more because of altitude making him go very slowly; hoped to go to top on 1 May but in fact descended next day with slight frostbite. Walsh summited on 30 Apr. 

Alan Hunt failed to acclimatize and went home early. Sirdar also ill from altitude after having gone to C4 quickly (a young Sherpa).

Team had hoped to ski the mountain, but too much ice so skis not used past ABC.

LO with expeditions from Tibet normally stay well down and want to know about teams from south only if these present a problem to leaders from north, according to climbers on Cho Oyu at same time as British.

Incredible!Just for your information: Flavio confirms that he and Lino Zani did NOT make the first ski descent ofCho Oyu. They took their skisup to about 7000m but then didn't use it todescend (""we were simply too tired, I didn't spend one thoughtin thinking to use them on our way down..."").

Ministry of Tourism Mountaineering Secition - Press Release

Two members of the 1988 Korean Chung Dang Alpine Club Churen Himal Expedition were successful to climb Mt Churen Himal at 10:20 hours on 7th May 1988.

They established C6 at 7210m on 5th May and stayed at the same camp. On 6th May they started from C6 at 04:55 hours and reached the summit at 10:20 hours on 7th May. The summiters hoisted the flags of Nepal and South Korea and photographed. They stayed about 55 minutes on the summit and returned to C2. There was strong wind blowing during their stay on the summit.


Expedition Report/Churen Himal East peak by the First Ascent route from Bulletin of Korean Alpine Federation:

Seven Jung-Dong Alpine Club members led by Chi Hoon-Ku set up camps on the West Ridge of Churen Himal East Peak.

The second attempt was tried by Jung-Dong Alpine Club (JAC). The first attempt was tried at premonsoon season last year, but compelled at the point of East Ridge 7200m.

Although Churen Himal East Peak was climbed by Korean Expedition party in 1970 for the first ascent, but Japan provoked doubts on their conquest for the lack of convincing evidence to prove their conquest.

JAC established BC at 4750m on March 26, and then C1, C2 and C3 at 5370m, 5760m and 6310m on March 29, April 7 and 10.

On April 11, Shin Jang-Sup and Kwan Dae-Sik started from C2 to carry loads to C3. Kwon fell in a crevasse near C3. Other members tried to rescue him even for 5 hours, they couldn't pull up his dead body.

They set up C4, C5 at 6610m, 6810m on April 16, 20. And then Shin Jang-Sup and Lee Heung-Sik proceeded towards the summit via East Ridge.

Two members confronted Pinnacle connected to East Peak at 1 km front of the summit. The prospective route situated in dangerous condition to pass only a keen and narrow pinnacle zone. The route passed steep ice and snow pinnacle. So they felt that they couldn't come back if they went forward continually and withdrew.

They depend upon 2 members and no Sherpas, they taking a detour route. On April 26, Shin and Lee moved C5 and set up 6680m on April 26. They approached the summit on the next day but the weather deteriorated when they arrived at the middle peak below 7280m. They made an unprepared bivouac at the point.

On April 20 they started to the top the ridge of Middle Peak connected to East Peak. The route from Middle Peak Col was pinnacle zone and the way after the route was mixed snow and rock in unstable conditions. They withdrew and came down lower camp. After laying in a supply of food and fuel from C2, they tried the 3rd attack, as the final attack.

On May 7, Shin and Lee proceeded towards the Summit at 4:50 am and stood on it 10:30 am.

To climb the route from C4 to the top, which was pinnacle and rock ridge route. They had to pass several rocks. Using 5 hackers and 20m fix rope used when they descended. It was a new approach to the West Ridge.",Kwon killed in crevasse; 1 porter carrying to C1 injured by falling stone,1st Korean ascent perhaps (not sure about 1970 Spring),Adventure Nepal,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453237,

Winter Ascent and Tragedy by Cho Hyung-Gyu

The party planned to climb the mountain through west ridge. They set up C1 at 5800m on Dec 3rd. They advanced mixed snow and rock in dangerous section and then set up C2 at 6800m. The weather deteriorating and they were storm-bound for 4 days.

The partly led on the difficult route and fixed a rope in the long and steep snow slopes to C3. Finally, they set up two box tents at C3 on spot of 7400m on 16th.

It was changed to the worst weather on the summit day but 1st attack party started to the summit. However they backed without moving more advance because there appeared the crevasse on the upper plateau below the summit ridge. Severe winner winds and considerable snowfall defeated their 1st attack party.

They revised all plans and entered the 2nd attack on 22nd. The member Oh Sei-Chul, Chun Bong-Gon, Kim Hwa-Gon and Bae Hyun-Chul departed C4 for the summit at 07:30. 4 members reached cornice below the summit. They climbed and at last got to the top at 14:05. Actually they succeed first winter ascent of Nuptse West. Even all members were unexperienced with the Himalayan mountains though they have achieved a real remarkable success.
 
They had on epic descent. The team described the struggle as ""Physically and mentally very demanding.""

On Dec 23 the 2nd attack party had left C4 for the summit but they evacuated because the strong wind and poor visibility.

On 21st Van Snick, Ang Rita and Ang Lhakpa Dorje (Ang Lhakpa of Everest 1985 spring summit) pitched camp at col. Left C3 8:30 and arrived 15:30. At midnight in bright moonlight left C4 for summit attempt by all three despite Ang Lhakpa's having been ill in evening twice. Van Snick and Ang Lhakpa used oxygen resting before start of climb on 21st night and during the climb above col Ang Rita carried full bottle for Van Snick. Was no wind, snow conditions very good. Ang Lhakpa had problem mask clogging with ice. 8 am arrived just below S Summit at 8700m and stopped to change Van Snick's oxygen bottle and drink tea. Ang Lhakpa fell on his back and slipped 8m, did not move, Ang Rita went to him and gave oxygen while Ang Lhakpa remained unconscious briefly then came around. Ang Rita spoke to him but Ang Lhakpa's speech confused. All three descended with Ang Lhakpa's walking roped between other 2; arrived at C4 9:30 am, rested 1 hrs, then Ang Lhakpa semi-conscious. Very strong wind and impossible to descend and had to return to tent almost immediately after they had started to descend; gave Ang Lhakpa more oxygen. By 4:00 pm it was clear descent impossible that day as wind stronger still. At night leg spasms; doctor thinks had cerebral thrombosis. At midnight Ang Lhakpa's oxygen empty and Van Snick stopped resting on oxygen and gave his to Ang Lhakpa. 2 am Ang Rita went out and found another bottle outside tent and Ang Lhakpa got new oxygen bottle. Ang Lhakpa found to be dead at 7 am while others trying to get radio contact with lower camps to ask 3 Sherpas come up to help. Still strong wind at col but on face not so bad and Ang Rita and Van Snick could descend and went to BC same day. Now decided Everest climb finished: exhausted and ill after 6 weeks on mountain, and strongest climbers, Ang Rita and Van Snick not in top condition. Soon afterwards came big storm which destroyed higher camps. No attempt to return to col for body.

If Van Snick and Ang Rita had gone to summit, would have gotten there at about 10:00 am and perhaps would not have survived descent.

Everest effort by Belgians failed - collapsed after 1st bid and Xmas at BC: 
1. No strong leadership - Detienne got sick and went to KTM; deputy leader Vreugde interest in scientific research for one month and not leadership; climbing leader Cornellissen not strong personality, too mild; Sirdar Ang Phurba's wife seriously ill and he left BC.
2. Psychological problem of first experience with winter's severe weather - Belgians not prepared for this
3. ""Low altitude"" sickness - Detienne would have died without use of 3 bottles of oxygen at and below BC.
4. Came too early in season - now is time to be mounting ascent, not Nov
5. Death (in this case Lhakpa Dorje's) is problem for young climbers and Tettelin, who is strong, took death very hard.
6. Few strong climbers: Miss Baeyeons (sick), Van Snick and Tettelin only.

Much money spent on expedition including 3 generators at BC for electric lights, 7 kitchen staff at BC, 2 Belgians at BC only for food and equipment, etc.


Detienne - 24 Dec 88

22nd early 1:00 am 3 start from S Col - 8:00 am reached just below S Col. Lhakpa Dorje sickness, lost control and collapsed in snow. Rudy and Ang Rita brought to South Col tent and gave higher flow of oxygen. Big snow and wind storm, stayed in col with sick man now in coma in late afternoon - 7:00 am died. Rudy and Ang Rita to BC late evening, leaving Lhakpa Dorje at Col; want to bring him down but winds preventing this.

Everest cancelled but 1 Belgian and 2 Poles try Lhotse. Stayed 10-14 days,
others leaving BC 23rd not so well; all others 27th leave BC. In KTM 31st.

On 22 Dec they started at 1 am from South Col toward the summit. At 8 am they reached just below 8700m. Sherpa Lhakpa Dorje collapsed to unconsciousness. Ang Rita and Rudy brought Sherpa to South Col. They put him on oxygen. That whole afternoon Sherpa was in coma. At early morning on 23rd Dec (7am) he died. In South Col there were no other member except summit party.

On 22nd due to very bad weather (storm, windy, snowfall) Ang Rita and Rudy cannot bring down Sherpa body.

After Lhakpa death two climbers left South Col and in the late afternoon, they reached base camp. It was not possible for them to bring down the dead body of Lhakpa due to exhaustion and bad weather.

Sherpa's are going to try to bring down the body if weather permits.

Wielicki on 28 Dec went up to Cwm to stop Sherpas, other 2 Poles and Ingrid to C2 on 29th but had bronchitis. 30th Wielicki took sleeping bag and equipment to see if C3 intact and try for top alone if good weather while others sick. 31st no clouds and wind and Wielicki went up quickly, not taking time for making C4. Started 4:20 am after having made a tent out of 2 torn tents; Cichy still sick but went up to C3 when saw Wielicki moving up from C3. Wielicki reached bottom of couloir at 10:15 am, 1-1/4 hours later than planned, but couloir was easy in good snow conditions in it. Reached summit 2:00 pm in little wind; returned to C3 at 5:00 pm, pushing and timing himself in descent not to rest too long each time and end up dead like Marcel Ruedi. Felt cold despite all warm clothing and one big toe frostbitten. 

No others to try Lhotse top: Ingrid sick throughout expedition; did not go above C2 for Lhotse (to C3 for Everest). Icefall in terrible conditions 40 ladders needed (1 place 4 ladders strung together) vs 2 in 1979-80. Belgians insisted on Everest attempt before Lhotse bid. After Poles prepared Cichy and Van Snick to make Everest bid and after they got to Everest top, Cichy and Wielicki (who would have come to Col) to go from Col to Lhotse summit (not on ridge but little below ridge) but Belgians determined to go home: pressure on Van Snick not to climb over Lhakpa Dorje's body.

Everest effort by Belgians failed - collapsed after 1st bid and Xmas at BC: 
1. No strong leadership - Detienne got sick and went to KTM; deputy leader Vreugde interest in scientific research for one month and not leadership; climbing leader Cornellissen not strong personality, too mild; Sirdar Ang Phurba's wife seriously ill and he left BC.
2. Psychological problem of first experience with winter's severe weather - Belgians not prepared for this
3. ""Low altitude"" sickness - Detienne would have died without use of 3 bottles of oxygen at and below BC.
4. Came too early in season - now is time to be mounting ascent, not Nov
5. Death (in this case Lhakpa Dorje's) is problem for young climbers and Tettelin, who is strong, took death very hard.
6. Few strong climbers: Miss Baeyeons (sick), Van Snick and Tettelin only.

Much money spent on expedition including 3 generators at BC for electric lights, 7 kitchen staff at BC, 2 Belgians at BC only for food and equipment, etc.


Detienne - 24 Dec 88

22nd early 1:00 am 3 start from S Col - 8:00 am reached just below S Col. Lhakpa Dorje sickness, lost control and collapsed in snow. Rudy and Ang Rita brought to South Col tent and gave higher flow of oxygen. Big snow and wind storm, stayed in col with sick man now in coma in late afternoon - 7:00 am died. Rudy and Ang Rita to BC late evening, leaving Lhakpa Dorje at Col; want to bring him down but winds preventing this.

Everest cancelled but 1 Belgian and 2 Poles try Lhotse. Stayed 10-14 days,
others leaving BC 23rd not so well; all others 27th leave BC. In KTM 31st.

On 22 Dec they started at 1 am from South Col toward the summit. At 8 am they reached just below 8700m. Sherpa Lhakpa Dorje collapsed to unconsciousness. Ang Rita and Rudy brought Sherpa to South Col. They put him on oxygen. That whole afternoon Sherpa was in coma. At early morning on 23rd Dec (7am) he died. In South Col there were no other member except summit party.

On 22nd due to very bad weather (storm, windy, snowfall) Ang Rita and Rudy cannot bring down Sherpa body.

After Lhakpa death two climbers left South Col and in the late afternoon, they reached base camp. It was not possible for them to bring down the dead body of Lhakpa due to exhaustion and bad weather.

Sherpa's are going to try to bring down the body if weather permits.

Hasegawa did not try face because ridge route leader Yoshio was in bad condition (stayed BC a while then left 20 Oct), so Hasegawa had to take over as ridge leader.

2nd death (of Moorhead) on 15th Oct - 2 out of 4 members gone.

Hard work making route from C2 to C3 because so much deep snow, it was necessary to excavate to get to rock for belays. By 14 Oct when reached 7600m had gotten to summit snowfields and were ready for summit push. Had climed all the hard part including great crack.


Fred From - 27 Oct 83

14 Oct Fred and Mark got to high point of 7600m fixing route to top of hard part of climb and just below French C5. No C4 even made as it would have been one a short distance above 7600m in final push.

14 Oct returned to C3 snow cave at 7000m. Peter was in BC. Went there on 14th. 15 Oct Fred and Mark continued descent to BC. At about 10:45 Mark fell (why no idea) on easy ground, good snow, clear weather and light wind. He was 40m vertically below Fred and about 100m away. He cart-wheeled in big movement suggesting he tripped or stumbled and his body fell about 600m vertically. From never got closer than 100m, so no idea exactly what killed him. Was lying peacefully on his back, head down, arms across chest.

Fred descended as quickly and safely as he could to find him since he'd disappeared from sight and to help him but from 100m could see no hope and too dangerous to go alone to him. Reached BC at dusk.
 
2 days later Peter and Fred tried to reach body but wind too strong. Went to C2 6580m and Mark's body at about 6280m. Necessary to go up to C2 and then try to reach him. Returned to C1. Peter said he did not go back above C2 and Fred's fingers and toes too cold-affected to solo it, which would have been possible; otherwise neither of us understood the accident, so we didn't trust our judgement any more.

Fred and Peter would like to return to West Pillar in pre-monsoon season when should not be so much snow and do climb alpine-style, not putting in fixed camps and rope as this autumn.

Peter returning to KTM with baggage; arrives in 10 days, possibly much sooner.


Makalu Expedition BC, 4 Oct 1983 - Peter Hillary

Fred, Mark and I have returned from the mountain where we have had a tragedy. While Fred and Bill Denz were descending from C2 to C1 on the 3rd of October at 2 pm. They were caught in an avalanche. Fred managed to extricate himself and Bill who was below, was swept one hundred meters into a snow basin below the ridge. There was a considerable accumulation of avalanche debris and there was no sign of him to be found. From the time of avalanche and until 6:30 pm (dark) we probed in the debris and searched crevasses but to no avail. Mark and I were at C1 and ascended to assist Fred in the search. The accident occured at 6400m and he was swept to the southern side of the ridge where he was buried under 3-4 meters of snow. The avalanche was 500 meters wide and Bill's body has not been found nor any of his equipment.


Report on accident involving the death of a member of the expedition.

Fred From, Mark Moorhead and myself have returned to BC today from the West Ridge of Makalu where we have had a tragedy. While Fred From and Bill Denz were descending from C2 to C1 on the 3rd of October at 2 pm, they were caught in an avalanche. From managed to extracate himself and Denz who was below, was swept one hundred meters in a snow basin below the ridge on the southern side. There was a considerable accumulation of avalanche debris (the avalanche break being 500m wide) and Denz was buried under 3-4 meters of debris and consequently, we could find no trace of him or any of his equipment.

The avalanche occurred at 6400m altitude. From the time of the avalanche and until darkness at 6:30 pm we probed the avalanche debris with a bamboo pole and ice axed and searched a nearby crevasse...but to no avail.

Moorhead and myself were at C1 at the time and observed Denz's fall in the avalanche. We ascended to assist From with the search. Denz died in the avalanche and was unrecovered.


Letter from Bill, Makalu BC - 13 Sept 1983

We are progressing with the route satisfactorily we are all getting on well and what's more, it the weather continues to be reasonable we have to make our summit bid towards the end of September. C1 is at 5900m and we have soloed the ridge to C2 at 6420m which is a snow cave at the foot of the really steep. (This camp is in the same vicinity as Roskelley's C2).

We hope to solo 1/2 way to C3 and fix the rock steps with rope. I expect to establish C3, at 7400m on about the 18th to 20t of September and then work on the main buttress done over the next 3 or 4 days. We hope to make a gear damp at the campsite sometime during the 21st to the 24th. Our C3 we hope to establish higher than the French/US camp so as to reduce problems for the summit day. Hopefully it will be at 7900m.


Letter from Bill - 13 Sept 1983

We have established C2 on the SW Pillar of Makalu at an altitude of 6480m. This is the same location as Roskelley's C2. We are using a safe roamy crevasse and have stocked it with food, fuel and rope. We go up to C1 tonight (amended height 5950m) and occupy C2 tomorrow. We hope to stay there for some time, working on the camps above.

We fixed no new rope to C2 and used only 10m of old fixed rope. The French ""Khumbakarna"" expedition arrived 4 days ago and are carrying loads to their C1 on Makalu II. They also have permission for Baruntse.","2 fatalities (1 by avalanche, 1 by fall)",,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2451295,

Leader's reports death of Robert G. Uttley, born 1961, geology student, Sheffield, on approx 14 Oct due to pneumonia and related illness at 6300m on East Ridge of Annapurna III. He was accompanied by Trevor Pilling, born 1956, student, Worcester.

The 2 men were caught in 5-day storm at this alitude (6300m). ""Uttley's condition gradually deteriorating to state where he was unable to function and even attempt retreat without further assistance of more members. Eventually on 13 Oct Trevor Pilling had to retreat in order to save his own life. Attempts to conduct a rescue were useless as the weather conditions were very bad (new snow) and this may have endangered further life.""

All 4 members had reached altitude 6150m, but 2 numbers, Uttley and Pilling had reached 6300m on 8 Oct. In evening of 8 Oct weather broke and they tried to descend but due to heavy snowfall and wind they could not come down, they were in a crevasse at that altitude.

Alwin Leitner - 11 Oct 83

Austrians on Manaslu could see Korean expedition and could see four figures climbing NE Face, so not solo climb. Had no skis so moving more slowly than Leitner. 

Koreans coming back to KTM, should arrive KTM 16 or 17 Oct.


The Plan

The next mountaineer to come with hopes for a solo ascent was a South Korean, Huh Young-Ho, a 29 year old cement company clerk  whose climbing experience also included a successful ascent of an 8000-metre mountain, Makalu, in the spring of 1982 on an expedition of which he was one amongst 16 members under another's leadership.

Huh was to make the first solo climb of Manaslu, at 8163m the world's eight highest mountain. He would try an alpine-style ascent with no fixed camps, no oxygen cylinders and no companions. But one or two Koreans and two high altitude Sherpas would be with him at base camp, and if his solo attempt failed, then he would enlist their help, pitch three high camps and get to the summit on a non-solo ascent.

The achievements 

Meanwhile the South Korean Huh had tried his own solo assault on Manaslu. His base camp had been pitched at 4800m on 14 Sept, but a long period of heavy snowfall followed, for the monsonn had not finished here. At last on 28 Sept he was able to spend his first night at 5200m. Next day he was moving higher when snow began falling and he was forced to retreat to base. That was the end of his solo attempt.

In early October Huh and two Sherpas twiced above up to C1 at 5200m and in the second push Huh and Ang Jangbu Sherpa went all the way to C3, which they put at 7200m. On 8 Oct Huh managed to get to Manaslu's summit plateau at perhaps 7600m, but once again bad weather forced a retreat.

Huh's ultimate push commenced on 16 October. He and Ang Jangbu gained C3 again on the 20th, waited out the strong winds of the 21st and finally Huh, having climbed the very last part from C3 struggle against nearly 1000 vertical metres of mountainside in very strong wind with no artificial oxygen to make the climb on hard snow and blue ice any easier.

Not far below the summit Huh had been met by three West Germans, an Italian and two Sherpas from a predominantly German expedition on Manaslu's South Face. He preceded them to the very top and then returned to his own C3 in four hours descent. He too was very weary when he joined Ang Jangbu in C3 but next day he went all the way down to base camp safely while the Sherpa, who was not well, stopped that night in C1.",,,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2451303,

C3 (avalanche started only 15m above C3). Jans was digging snow cave to replace tent and he was carried 200m down and went up and started digging for others. Those who survived were Elsner, Fichter, Hoess, Kruis and Schmidt.

Only 2nd degree frostbite for Elsner, Fichter, Jans, Hoess; no other accidents.


Stelfox, et al, British (Irish) - 19 & 20 May 1984

Germans in autumn 1983 used same route in much of their climb as Irish this spring. Irish found their camps, fixed ropes and two bodies 10m apart, one in a sleeping bag and other sitting up.

Only route difference appears to have been between Irish ABC and C1.

Route was up a spur on SW Face to South Ridge for West Peak.

Between C1 and C2 much snowfall which destroyed C1 and ropes. Between C2 and C3 much rock and icefall so could work only very early in morning when cold. Difficult rock climbing just above C2 at 5500m (100m high rock well) then moved climbing and again 50m rock wall - 60 degree steepness. Both days on S Summit very strong wind and cold. No attempt to go beyond S Summit. 1 more week needed to carry equipment and fix ropes. No time, ropes and strength left after 4 Nov (had received 1 week's extension).

Press Release

Climbing a difficult route on the north ridge of their 6812m mountain, which is near Mount Everest, four members reached the summit on Oct 22. They included the expedition's climbing leader, Hans Berger, 35, from Davos-Frauenkirch, Switzerland.

Wettstein managed to return to the team's highest camp at about 6200m at nearly 10 o'clock that night to tell others about their weak condition and need for help. But Miss Senn spent the night alone a little distance above the camp and its shelter. Both had frostbite and Wettstein slight head wounds from a minor accidents when Miss Senn fell on him and the steel spikes fitted to her boots cut him.

It was during their descent on Oct 27, the day after they had attempted to go to the summit, when Miss Senn was being helped down the mountain side by Bumann, that these two, who were roped together, fell, killing Miss Senn outright and so injuring Bumann so that he died a day later at BC.

Wettstein was not involved in this fall, but his condition required helicopter evacuation to KTM. Supersaxo came with him and said last night that Wettstein is not really seriously ill, although he is staying in hospital here for a few days.

Fatal avalanche took two lives and destroyed considerable amount of equipment in C2. Snow much better than German route, but best route is from SW as marked on postcard. Both bodies found eventually and buried at C2.

2 Gritzners were in C2 night of 10/11 Oct but Karl Gritzner got fever/headache from sun and wanted to go down on 11th and brothers volunteered to go down with him as not safe to descend alone; 2 brothers reached BC 6:30 am. 

Yes, could have done so [reached summit] in few more days. From glacier northeast of mountain climbed up icefall to rib then slope. C2 in place safe from avalanches but perhaps wind from avalanche [caused fatal accident].

Took 9 hours to get to C2 because so much snow and arrived at 5:00 pm. Took time to find one of 2 tents. Found Pfeifer in one of them dead under snow; descended on 14th. Reiss and Becker again up to search at C2 on 15th.

2 members were at C2 on 11 Oct and members at BC tried to contact by walkie-talkie at 8 pm but no contact. Bad weather in 1/2 meter snow. 12th morning again tried to contact C2 but no response all day.

3 members from C1 started to C2 (on date unknown). Found tents buried under snow at C2. Digging in snow under one tent, found of Karl Pfeifer because its late at night they could not search other members tent. Other man was Udo Ertl.

3 searchers returned to C1. 2 of them stayed in C1 and BC at midnight (date still not known) and said 2 now in C2 died of suffocation from an avalanche leader mate on 14 Oct.

Mayr and Kleissl down with Amann and arrived C2 at 8:00 pm in full moon despite Amann's fall into crevasse. 2 Sherpas arrived 9:00. Oelz having gone astray, partly because of German voice ""heard"" and fallen down steep ice, at 12:00 took biv in terrible icefall. BC saw him wave for help. Slept 2 hours then understood his position and went down SW Face to BC. Very steep and avalanching, went down with avalanche 100-300m flying and turning over: ""I used all the luck"" - stopped 400m above C2. Other Austrian summiters got him down to C2 at 9 pm on 23rd.

No more to top because 20 cm fresh snow fall night of 23/24 Oct. Very dangerous between C1 and C2 and a little higher overhung by huge seracs that avalanched. Icefall in this area not very difficult but more dangerous than Khumbu Icefall.

Had some route finding problems because of need to go around crevasse. Fixed 100m rope and again 200m (2 sections) below C1 and also used some old ropes; also 50m just below Great Shelf in seracs on very narrow ledge (most dangerous pass).

No injuries except slight frostnip of toes and fingers; fell twice into crevasse to waist.


Pierre Beghin - 5 Nov 1983

I think it is difficult to say: ""so happy, but so tired."" The very happy because at the climb alone I began in March to organize expedition - during 6 minutes ""very anxious"" since all depended on him.

""For me it was bigger achievement"" than technical difference W Face of Manaslu which he climbed with Muller. ""There is some fascination to be alone"" but also very hard moments in camp when you are alone and you think a lot."" When climbing is Ok.


Mrs Ranville - 27 Oct 1983

Beghin did entire climb absolutely alone. All load carries. everything.

She left BC on 17 Oct when he was going to top. He should have left BC about 24 Oct to arrive KTM about 1 Nov.

Letter from P. Beghin, BC 5400m - Sept 17th

Our BC was established two days after an approach march 19 days long. From Hile to Yamphudin in 10 days with 38 porters (25 ropes by day); from Yamphudin to Ramche; 4 days with Yamphudin porters (200 ropes). From Ramche (4500m) to BC normally 3 days but 28 from our 35 porters decided to come back. So with 7 porters remaining it took 6 days. We helped them to carry, so we paid 600 rupees by charge between Yamphudin and BC and shoes and food to provide.

This morning I carry to 6200m about on the ridge before the cliff to climb down - heavy snow-cloudy, 3-1/2 hours. Some crevasses to take care because I was alone.

Report of Climbing Tilicho by Leader Lee Yong-Ho

On November 19, we set out for Tilicho. It was Nov 24 when we passed through the last village of Manang, where we had found all the way from Kanshara to Low BC being destroyed badly as there had been no one who passed the way until we got there. We had to fix them up. It was really hard work and we felt like exhausted all our energy there, moreover we had to have porters move all the way by the help of ropes. We got to Low BC 4200m high on Nov 26. There all the porters gave up and went back. Only seven persons were left, we four alpinishts, a region officer, an old sardar and a kitchen boy.

Now what we got to do from now on have to be done by ourselves. On Nov 27 we began to transfer our cargo up to Tilicho Lake. It took five days to cross the lake and to get to the high BC which is very start line of our climbing. It was Dec 5 that we could finish transferring all our cargo. It was really hard work because of no high land porter to help us and even an old sardar and region officer did not give us any help, but only the kitchen boy assisted us for three days before we get to Tilicho Lake. It is in fact really more than we can explain how hard we worked. We were tired and we had to take rest whole day on Dec 6. Next day we left the base camp for climbing the last course. We did not take the route many foreign climbers sued to try, but the virgin route which nobody has ever tried before. It was the route of great couloir, between North Ridge and NW Ridge. We began to climb on Dec 7. Length of the route to the peak is 1100m of 50 degrees slope which was made of ice, snow and rocks and yet must of all were covered with thick snow. We were always facing the very danger of falling rocks and ice. Dec 7 is the first day of our climbing. We bivoucked at the upper part of couloir. Next day we were away from couloir and got to the North Ridge. We went 400m ahead of knife ridge, where we bivouaced again. It is 6100m high there.

On Dec 9, we kept on climbing and could get to the crossing point of North Ridge and NW Ridge. It took three days for us to reach there. It was the last place that we bivouacked. On Dec 10, all members tried to attack the peak with light equipments and some clothes, but unfortunately he had to give it up and go down because of mountain sickness. I had to go down together to help him. Only two alpinists, Bong-Wan Jang and Dae-Pyo Yun were left there and kept attacking the peak. They bivouacked at the point of 7000m high. Next morning they went around great cornice to attack the peak. At 10:30 at last they conquered the peak. Team corporation, strong determination and patience brought us the result of success.

The peak was rather milder and wider than we thought. They felt as if they could see all the Himalaya in one sight. Wonderful! Wonderful! There is no word to explain. But after thirty minutes severe winter wind forced them to withdraw down to the point of 6600m high, where I and all members were waiting for them.

On Dec 12, we withdrew there and got to the high BC on Dec 13. Our expedition was done successfully.
 
During this expedition we have experienced many difficulties because of the limitation of our expenditure, however we were quite satisfied with the fact that we could conqer the virgin peak through the route nobody ever tried before.

Terrible winds: sometimes climbers had to wait 15-20 minutes lying down before wind abated and they could move. C3 tents frequently destroyed. ""Never again in winter"" says Korniszewski will he climb. 2000m fixed rope entire route.

Jaworski had failed to use both fixed ropes. Very dangerous short section of route which could not be avoided. After Jaworski's accident, put in still more ropes making three to be used at same time.

Took long time to establish C4: 3 days out for Xmas celebrations with tree, 3 days lost replacing lost gear. Much fixed rope required on this section.

Details of the climbing by Leader Garayoa

From C4 the members of the first group Juan Oiarazabal, Juanjo Amezgarai, Miquel and Inaki summited on the top of 8201m high Cho Oyu mountain on 15th May 1985. The time was at 1:15 pm of summit without oxygen form the route of SS Cho Oyu. They started from C4 at 4 in the morning the same day at 6:00 am. The 1 group stayed at the summit for 1 hour.

They took some photograph. Hoisted Nepalese and Basque flag on the top. They found Chinese-like Tibetan metalic flag at the summit. It was 1.50 mts high, different colors of seven starts on it. They were very happy. But it was too cold. It was clear all around but wind. They saw mountain Everest from the top and took photography of mtn.

The second group including three members leader Xabier, Felipe and Atxo from the C4. Started early in the morning of 17th May at 6:00 am to the summit, from the SW Ridge of Cho Oyu. They reached on the top of Cho Oyu at 12:00 pm. They stayed 45 minutes on the top. They took photograph from there around. They saw from there Mount Everest, Lhotse, Tibet and took photography also. The weather was very good but very cold. The wind was normal. They also saw the Chinese and Tibetan flag. They put the Basque and Nepalese flag there and took picture of it.

In this team the team leader had put one electrocardiogram matching on his body and heart, which reflected all his feeling and condition of heart of every second. It was recorded in a ultra-modern heart tape recorder (as a part of medical investigation which the team was doing in tbe BC camp, one Dr. Pepe and one nurse Maurice). The same time when expedition was going on.

When the team was at the BC, the aluminium tent was put for the medical purposes, the test began for the members who were climbing, after climbing the health condition of before and after of climbing. The findings of this investigation would take to publish for a year, the investigation will finish. When all the member would be in Spain and tested again for the last time.

Detail of Descending from the Summit:

The first and second groups descended the same day they summited. Had on the top to C4 on 15th May and 17th May respectively. Next day the group to the C1 on 16th May and 18th May respectively. The first group came to the BC on 17th of May and second group came to the BC on 19th of May.

The expedition team returned from BC to KTM on 22nd of May with 23 porters. The group divided in Namche after 3 days into two because of cargo. 9 members liaison officer and mailrunner fly from Lukla to KTM on 25 of May and two members including team leader and kitchen boy and cook came from the previous caravan route of Lukla-Jiri walking with 23 porters and by bus from Jiri to KTM.

When we left the summit we took back all of our ropes, tent from each camp, we satisfied there is nothing leaving on the mountain. In the BC, also according to the instruction of liaison officer and team leader all rusted things were burnt, all plastic and other garbage were buried near the base camp. All round the BC was cleared.

After establishing C2, 6 members were ferrying loads from C2 to C3 site with view of establishing C3. On 16 May Sandor Csanadi (born '49, engineer Budapest) and Peter Greskovits ('52 pharmacist, Budapest) carried loads to C3 but did not return to C2 to stay overnight. Then BC and C2 tried to contact them by walkie-talkie but no contact, consequently in moving of 17 May other members and sirdar started to search for them from C2 to C3, but they were not traced.

Search continued next 2 days May 18 and 19 from C2 to C3 and when had reached near C3 at 4:30 pm, the wind was blowing at 130 km/hr and might have been blown away by the wind.

On May 20 2 members, Jozsef Csikos ('54, engineer Miskola) and Laszlo Voros and sirdar Pemba Norbu Sherpa established C3 at 7100m on north side of mountain. Expedition planned to make summit bid on May 22 or 25.

Above 6800m snow slope 45 degrees 250m section and above it loose rock and very short sections of steepness. Above 6800m is on ridge. Frequent fall on the mountain.

Three Romanian members and six Nepalese climbed on this route. Romanians were Marcus, Ritisan and Muresan. Leader did botanical works.

Expedition split into 2 groups after they could not agree on the route all would climb. Original route was South Face and SE Ridge over Konaban Peak. All but three thought route to be too dangerous, so switched to NW Face to W Ridge route from Kaphe Khola.


Ang Karma (co-Leader in name only) - 9 June 85

3 sides no good to climb, not enough rope to fix it. Abandon climb or do something else: recced Konabon South Face to East Ridge left to Gurja. Some thought this possible, others possible but risky. Leader thought better to do Japanese side which earlier. The 3 more enthusiastic wanted to try Kanaban way but only for 10 days as future experience (plus one Romanian support man and no Sherpas; 4 other Romanians and 4 Nepalese members went to Japanese route). 2 May two parties split. Tareja Khola camp was where split: about 2 days before S Face BC, southeast of it. Went on Japanese route and on 17 May 3 Nepalese to top, 18 May 3 Romanians (except Bojor) and 2 Nepalese Tamangs and all down safely. Left BC 20 May.
 
20 May received letter dated 19 May from Coliban via local porter. Letter reported accident on 15 May. Coliban had swollen tooth at their C1 while Dutescu-Coliban and Vergulescu in good condition and recce separately: she to right from their camp 5600-5700m and he to extreme left of S Face of Konaban. Weather started to deteriorate: fog and perhaps snow and she to their camp. Vergulescu did not return. In evening when weather cleared a Coliban and Dutescu-Coliban searched unsuccessfully until dark.

16 May 3:30 am Coliban and Dutescu-Coliban again searched found Vergulescu's footprints and in daylight saw him in front of serac barrier, badly injured in mid-forehead and guessed bit by rock or serac and had died immediately. He had no crampons, no rucksacks, no helmet. They buried his body where found it.

Wrote they had come down to Tareja camp and said they would wait there 2-3 days for response and would go up to clear mountain of equipment (maybe in meantime, maybe later).

Bojor and Ang Karma made replies and local man took them 22nd May waiting for snowfall to stop and would be received same day.

21st May porters had arrived at Bojor camp and camp evacuated 22nd May. Reached Pokhara and KTM 28 May without having seen others (Bojor walked more slowly and arrived KTM 3-4 days later). Checked at Beni and post at Arpang before Beni but no information regarding others.

Now many days. They should have arrived Pokhara days ago. I hope they haven't gone to Dhaulagiri. Were ""different kind of people."" ""stubborn"" - he good team spirit.


Bojor - 8 Jun 85

Last news of three members who have not yet arrived KTM is letter dated 19 May. Since then no word at all about them. If still no word by noon tomorrow, will take decision in Ministry of Tourism about sending search party.


Ang Karma - 13 Jun 85

Yesterday a Sherpa went by bus to Pokhara, going to missing persons BC, asking locals and police post on the way. Will not go to Dhaulagiri but will return to KTM with any information he collects. May be back in KTM in 8 days, may be danger depending on whether he has to go all the way to their BC.


Kunga Sherpa - 11 Jun 85

A Sherpa flies to Baglung tomorrow to try to trace 3 missing Romanians. He carries letters from HMG to police and local authorities.

Trio had not good supply of food and now it is almost 4 weeks since letter of 19th May - visas expired 4 June.

Taina wanted to climb Dhaulagiri I. Ambitious to climb higher than Romanians who scaled peak in Pamirs higher than Gurja. They may have gone to Dhaulagiri and had accident.

Another possibility is they may have sought political asylum. Taina lived for several years in US.

Bojor's posting in KTM is finished.


Ravin Lama - 9 Jun 85

Only Marcus amongst Romanians actually reached summit of Gurja. They are saying 3 got to the top because leader had to sign papers in Bucharest guaranteeing success and with 1 member dead, they needed more Romanian summiters.

Ang Karma has told Ravin all this in detail. Leader is trying to get journalism scholarship for Ang Karma in Romania.


Pavel & Taina - 19 May 1985

We are deeply grieved to tell you that, instead of being with you now - a thing which seemed almost certain as things were going - we have to send you the worst news there is. Cesar is dead. It happened on 15 May, in the middle of the Konaban wall. We had set up C2 above the serac field visible from below, a little left of the big icefall, on a flat snowfield. In the morning at 9 o'clock we went to make a reconnaissance, Taina towards the Col at the basis of the ridge on the extreme right, Cesar upwards on the ridge left of the icefall, in order to see where it was better to continue the route. We reckoned to set up one more camp before on on the main ridge. Emil stayed at the tent - he had a swollen tooth and was on antibiotics. Taina came back around noon, the fog had set in already. It continued foggy until 5-6 pm, so we tried in vain to see Cesar, and he did not answer our calls. Towards evening, when it cleared up, Emil started after him, but found no sign before nightfall. In the morning we started at about 3:30, we followed his steps in the snow slopes and after going a little higher, we saw him below as to the right, fallen under the big serac barrier, on the upper part of the dejection  cone. We reached him as the sun was rising. He had one terrible blow in the middle of this forehead, and it was he had been lying night. Death must have been instantaneous. We think we had not seen him the night before because of irregularities in the slope. He had no rucksack, no anorack and no crampons on, and we suppose that he either slipped or more probably received a piece of ice or rock as he had stoppd to put on more clothes some time during the afternoon of 15 May. We buried him in the snow where we found him. Everything was going all right, we should have been on the summit in 3 days. We were feeling all right, lacking nothing. We do not think it was recklessness or imprudence. The conditions were good. The route is fairly easy, it presents no special problems in that area, no objective danger on the ridge Cesar took, or was supposed to take. It was terrible bad luck. But, as it happens in the mountains, big or small, anyone at anytime can meet with bad luck. We, Emil and Taina, considered that we must get down as soon as possible to announce the liaison officer who knows what should be done in such cases. We got to Jungle BC on 18th May, were we found Cornel, who had been to our BC (4600m), the day before, but had not seen us because of the fog and the distance.

We are sending this message with a Tareja man, who must bring bad news from you. We will do the following thing:
- go up again to bring down what we left in C1
- carve an inscription for our Cesar on a rock up there in base camp and try to put up a cross.

In the meantime we hope to have an answer from you (3-4 days).

As we understand that the LO is back in Kathmandu, we think the official message regarding the accident should be sent to Kunga Sherpa. We will prepare a detailed report. We made some photos at the site of the accident.

On face at C2 the technical difficulties occurred: steep rock and ice with some rockfall; also avalanching elsewhere.

Well to Col was 27 pitches of fixed rope on ice - very demanding hard work to climb. Last few days of the climb the winds reversed and came from Sikkim but then shifted back again. Very little snow on mountain till last week when snow collected.

Shrestha, Tourism - 24 May 85

Kangchenjunga from Skreslet to Ministry of Tourism:

""As of 15 May we evacuated the mountain having reached a high point of 25,500-26,000 ft on 13 May attempting to establish C4, failing to reach that camp, equipment was stashed at halfway point and the 2 members, John Roskelley and Kim Momb, came down off high ridge to C2.

Same day Laurie Skreslet and Gregg Cronn advanced to C3 in preparation for summit bid. After 2 days in C3 on morning of 2nd summit bid, Gregg Cronn was stricken with cerebral edema on 15 May and had to be evacuated of the mountain. He was helped down from 24,500 ft to 16,000 ft at BC and eventually recovered.

From April 22nd it took approximately a week to stock pile C2 before pushing up the ridge from this North Col to the site of C3 at the base of the great serac slope.

Then after stock piling C3 waiting for the weather to abate before fixing rope to the top of the cliff to the great serac slope and eventually setting out for C4. That took up to May 15. ""The main reason for quitting the mountain was bad weather.""

BC - 10 Apr 85

We reached BC, 4010m, yesterday. The route to khola was quite difficult and we had to send back most of our porters halfway; only with 20 of them - going back and forward - we could go ahead.

We are on the left side of khola between the Herzog BC (1950) and Sigayret BC (1984).

The NW Face of Annapurna looks steep and difficult; anyway we will make a direct route between the Sterner attempt and the Sigayret attempt.

Tonight we had a bad storm and the kitchen broke. We have 20 cm of fresh snow.

On the 12th April we will go to look for a route throughout the icefall on the foot of our face. The first part of the wall we will fix with ropes. From 6000m onwards it is our plan to try it in alpine style.


Letter from Messner, BC - 26 Apr 85

Hans Kammerlander and I climbed up to the summit of Annapurna I on a totally new route:

20/4 C1 easy good weather
21/4 C2 fixed ropes, good weather
22/4 bivouac 7200m, snowstorm
23/4 bivouac 7500m good weather, windy 
24/4 summit, strong wind
25/4 BC, snow danger
26/4 all of the members are in the BC; snow avalanches in the face.

Now we will wait for a second attempt for the other three.

Over route is a fine line, partly extremely difficult and dangerous (extremely) in case of new snow. We had a few good, clear days and came back before a long snowfall. Frostbitten fingers (Hans and I), need rest so bad. Now we wait for the Dhaulagiri.

Next morning on terrain new to them and kept to left of big snow field to summit ridge. There were five summits on this ridge and the 5th one is the highest one. Most expeditions probably do not actually reach true summit in mist. In descent had to stay on ridge but for one hour had painful electricity pulling Messner's hair.

Tukuche - 8 May 85

We are on the way to it [Dhaulagiri]; only 3 porters, 2 mailrunners, 1 Sherpa, 1 cook, 1 LO and 2 members. I think it is the smallest expedition to a 8000er peak ever.

On Annapurna we were very lucky, the last day of good weather we could reach the summit. (Bad wind, still our feet hurting from being frostbitten on the summit day). The second attempt you can here from the friends [Patscheider, Rieser, Schiestl]. They should be in KTM.


Dhaulagiri BC - 16 May 85

On May 12 we reached (via Dhampus and French Col) the BC (4600m).

On May 13 Hans Kammerlander and I climbed up to the Col (2 Sherpas helped carry, since Hans and I had to fix a few ropes). We two went ahead, the Sherpas turned back to BC. We had our first bivouac on 6300m. Windy.

On May 14 Hans and I climbed the NE Ridge and had a biv of 7350m. Very windy and snow in the afternoon. Night not bad.

On May 15 we reached the summit - a very very long ridge - on 12:00 hours - stayed for half an hour (windy, electricity in the air, pains in the hair, sounds on the ice axes, dangerous).

On our way back we had bad visibility, wind; we reached the biv at 7350m, very bad night. On May 16th we climbed back for BC downwards. Not any serious problems. Saila and Phurba observing us with the binoculars from the BC came up to ours to help.

After accident decided Poles not time enough to reach to via East Ridge after time spent evacuating accident victims to get good acclimatization and climb very difficult route. Had agreed with Tourism Ministry in KTM might spend small party round to Spanish route and on 18 May could see 2 Americans at 7500m only. So on 18 May sent Gardzielewski and Jezierski who made alpine style ascent alone, following Spanish (and Chinese) route to top. Fell in crevasse on 27th and stopped there that night.

Here tried Tibetan side looking for escape route around gully system - gully drops 1000m or more of rock into Tibet and low on climbers and equipment, couldn't go further. Should establish camp near gully and 4-man team with at least 200m of rope and 30 pitons to get across this difficult section. So gave up Cho Oyu and concentrated on Ngojumba since only 2 men now on ridge route.

Could have climbed East Ridge if had been more members support. Only 2 Americans and 2 Poles (Jankowiak and Otreba) enthusiastic about it and expedition sort of fell apart with Gardzielewski keen on South Pillar or South Face.

Ascent route E Ridge via S Face of Ngojumba Kang; highest point at E Ridge Gully; descent route E Ridge. 

When it became clear that the difficult E Ridge was likely to be an unsurmountable obstacle after valuable time had been lost from a huge avalanche, Gardzielewski and Jezierski went around to the western side of the mountain to reach the summit via the normal route after 5 bivouacs.

Had deep fresh snow. May be possible in one day to climb face from biv at 5900-5400m to summit via face route if in good health and no deep snow. On this face climb Yagi had stomach trouble which meant low 1st biv and slow progress next day - carried 2 days food.

Quick climb (contrasted with Peter Hillary's) required ""an idea, a plan."" Messner or Roskelley would not want to stay a week on that face.
 
4th May Ishibashi killed in fall for unknown reasons while descending. Ariaka some frostbite but not very serious. Was cold weather and he was weak.

No avalanching - saw none at all even with fresh snow.


Sakashita - 14 May 85

28th reached Ama Dablam BC.

29th Ariake and Sakashita attempted W Face; biv at 5100m; Ishibashi, Toyoda and Yagi to attempt SW Ridge same day.

In this season lot of new snow on both ridge and face (20 cm), bad conditions.

West Face-SW Ridge Traverse:
29 Apr  - Ariake and Sakashita biv at 5100m
30 Apr  - Sakashita and Ariake reached 6250m on face. Ariake had stomach trouble
          and ate nothing on 29th but decided nonetheless to go up face but very
          slow. Used no rope, no tent, no sleeping bag, joint bivy sack.
1 May   - traversed face to night almost same route as Peter Hillary route, 
          6550m biv, no gas left, so no tea.
2 May   - 10:20 am reached summit from face, beautiful day. Biv at 6050m 
          (again no hot drink) on SW Ridge.
3 May   - Sakashita and Ariake to BC via ridge. Ariake same frostbite but not serious.

SW Ridge:
29 Apr  - Ishibashi, Toyoda and Yagi reached 5600m on SW Ridge. Went to ridge 
          cause face too dangerous for all to go up it. Must move quickly and 
          need experience.
30 Apr  - 6050m Ishibashi and Toyoda reached on ridge while Yagi turned back 
          with tooth trouble and allergic.
1 May   - 6100m on long difficult ridge
2 May   - 6500m
3 May   - summit to biv at 5950m
4 May   - 7:00 am walkie-talkie contact from Ishibashi. They too had no drink and
          food last night because stove broken. Will start descent Ishibashi said. 
          Used same rope for couple of pitches. Vertical rock face even 
          overhanging 2-3m, very difficult. Ishibashi below led and suddenly he
          had disappeared. 2 hours after left biv Ishibashi fell. 12:20 pm Toyoda
          arrived BC and reported accident. Exhausted same day Yagi and Sakashita
          went up SW Ridge to 5600m.
5 May   - 10:00 and 11:00 am reached accident point at 5900m where Toyoda had left
          backpack. Toyoda saw red dot on W Face icefall which was Ishibashi. 2 
          now returned to BC.
6 May   - Sakashita Yagi, Toyoda and Dr Stefan Goldberg went to icefall (very
          difficult) and found big crevasses between body and selves so couldn't
          reach body. Snowstorm forced retreat to BC.
7 May   - Up again via rock ridge and down to crevasses and found body at 5300m
          ond skull broken (died immediately after fall). Sakashita and Toyoda 
          wrapped his body and carried it down.
8 May   - Brought body to BC.
9 May   - Cremated body with Thyangboche Lama, Sherpas, Goldberg present.
          Brought bones for family.
10 May  - All left BC.


Sakashita - 2 April 85

Ishibashi leads one team to Cholatse while Sakashita others to Tawoche. After these finished, exchange mountains. Take about 3 weeks for this. Then all 7 move to Mingbo to Ama Dablam W Face. If we pass through in just 1-2 days will be Ok. During recce last year Irawa saw avalanches. Looks risky but somehow stable I think. Hillary party stayed on that route 10 days but Japanese will have acclimatized on other two mountains and Ama Dablam will not be so difficult for us. Will not used fixed ropes. Hope for very fast alpine-style climb with no ropes (only climbing rope), no tents (3 biv sacks).

On entire climb of 4 mountains, no Sherpas, no oxygen at all also on all 4 mountains.

Cho Oyu only Ishibashi and Sakashita (others go home after Ama Dablam). SE Face Australian route or Poles S Pillar. ""I pray to the god to find it easy, safe."" We are Buddhist like Nepali and Tibetans so maybe the god will find us route?

Cholatse: first try N Face but with little time, if route very hard will change to US or Swiss route. Depends on condition of route (whether enough snow or ice on face in spring - autumn best season to climb N Face).

BC at Pheriche. LO and kitchen boy there (no sirdar on expedition).

Expedition stopped climb as usual after a death. Had hoped to send 10 members to top. All had gone very quickly and smoothly. Route easier than 1979 West Ridge Everest climb but as difficult as South Face Makalu. Connecting ridge very long bad rock.

Bergant fell at 9:00 pm on 22nd because very tired without oxygen was at about 8300m just below connecting ridge.


Short outline of the first ascent of Yalung Kang (8505m) Expedition from from the north by the leader Tone Skarja

The place for first camp was reached. On this day we decided to continue Warth's route (1983) in North Face of Kangchenjunga to snow couloir between Kangchenjunga and Yalung Kang and across snow slopes and ridge to the summit of Yalung Kang (8505m). Later a party of four climbers should try to climb North Buttress to the summit in alpine style and descend across new normal route. We decided to establish only 4 camps.

On April 1st we established Camp 1 (5820m, 4 tents).

From April 2nd to 8th: a steep ice step between 6000m and 6200m was climbed and equipped with fixed ropes and ladder.

On April 9th Camp 2 was pitched.

From April 10th to 14th: The steepest part of the face was equipped with fixed ropes (6700-7350m).

On April 15th Camp was pitched.

On April 16th Bence and Podgornik climbed the hardest part of the face (7500m) and reached snow slopes which are leading to rocky summit pyramid of Yalung Kang.

On April 19th Kozjek the member of next climbing party reached the place for camp 4. Karo passed the night in tent, but he returned to T1 next morning.

On April 21st Bergant, Cesen and Pemba Nuru Sherpa brought oxygen equipment and bottles to T4. Later Pemba Nuru returned to T3.

On April 22nd at 6:30 Bergant and Cesen left T4. Bergant decided to climb without additional oxygen. From couloir between Kangchenjunga and Yalung Kang they reached East Ridge of Yalung Kang. They climbed it on south side (bad rock). At 14:30 after radio contact with BC they found a good passage around rocky edge and at 15:00 they reached very steep snow field which led them to the summit. They reached the summit at 16:30. This was the first ascent of Yalung Kang from the north side. On the summit they found bamboo stick of Korean Expedition and they left Cesen's oxygen bottle. They took some photos with Slovene-Nepali flags and at 17:00 they left summit. At 17:00 they had last radio contact with BC. During their ascent and descent the weather was fine.

In the last difficult place in snow couloir Bergant slipped without any objective reason and disappeared in depth at 21,000 during their preparation for abseiling. Due to crevasses above T4 Cesen stopped his descent and made a narrow terrace in ice slope where we talked all the night not to fall asleep and get frostbite. With Bergant also Walkie-Talkie was lost.

On April 23rd at 7:00 Cesen descended to T4. From BC we saw two persons descending but later we made sure that was only our imagination. During his descent Cesen looked over crevasses but he didn't find any trace of his friend. He had a short rest in T4 and later continued his descent. At 10:30 he met Bende and Podgornik and via their walkie-talkie sent report about accident to BC.

They all together with Jeglic descended to T1 and next day to BC. Cesen didn't get any serious injuries he suffered only on dehydration and doctor helped him with infusion next day.

We decided to stop our expedition.

On April 24th we were looking for traces of Bergant in the face under T4 in the height of T2 (6500m). During last night a new snow fell and avalanches were so often that it was impossible to find anything.

From April 24th to 27th the weather was getting worse during evacuation from the mountain. We evacuated all the camps except T4.

On April 29th we had commemoration near base camp on Pangpema. On big rock we cut Bergant's name.

On April 29th we prepared the last equipment for departure (all together 110 loads).

From April 30th to May 12th our return march Pangpema to Hile. We stayed one day in Ghunsa.

From May 13th to 14th truck and bus transport Hile to Kathmandu.

From May 15th to 22nd we had to stay in KTM because off problems with airway tickets and to clear all formalities.

From May 22nd to 27th flight KTM to Ljubljana.

Poles made the first significant attempt on the South Face in 1983, coming in from the left to gain the steep, shallow couloir left of the Central Pillar. Wieslaw Grzybowski, Lech Kiedrowski, Andrzej Mirga and Tadeusz Preyzner reached ca 6000m before making a difficult retreat in heavy snowfall. In 1985 the same line was attempted by Tsuyoshi Ohizumi and Kensaku Sakai. Three years previously the latter had made a notable first ascent of 7163m Hachindar Chhish in the Karakoram. The Japanese pair climbed in three days to 6100m when Sakai fell and hit his head. They bivouacked and descended the next day, but at 5900m Sakai fell again, this time to the bottom of the face. Ohizumi was unable to locate his body and the face was left alone until 2011 when Stefan Glowacz, David Goettler and Klaus Fengler arrived to attempt the Central Pillar.

Garayoa and Uriarte - June 3, 85

The Chinese approached Cho Oyu via the Gyabrag Glacier from the north and then followed the same route via West Ridge-West Face, the normal route, as the Spaniards also followed.

The Spanish Basques found the Chinese Tibetans fixed ropes and broken Chinese made ice axes along the route. On the summit they found a small metal Chinese flag, a red rectangle with seven gold stars.

The Basques did not actually see the Tibetans themselves, the Basques said. They were busy at base camp and deposit camp until early May, by which time the Tibetans had left the mountain. (Very probably the Basques were actually lying low until the Tibetans finished their climb so that the Basques would not be seen by Chinese to have crossed the border into Tibet).

The others, led by team leader Renqing Pingcuo, bore in mind the trust placed in them by people throughout the country and the Autonomous region. They encouraged one another by means of brief speech or gesture when they came to the end of a long ice and snow slope, the nine mounaineers were surprised to find light ahead and no more height was in sight. What they saw was cloud under their feet and blue sky emerging above.

At 17:50 hours CST (15:35 NST) the nine Tibetan alpinists successfully, ascended the world's sixth highest mountain and planted the five star flag atop it. Renqing Pingcuo reported in ultra short wave walkie-talkie. The other members took photos, collected specimens and mark inscribed with the words ""The Tibetan Mountaineering Expedition"" and the design of the five star flag. After remaining atop for half an hour, the nine summiters brimming with victory and lofty sentiments, descended. Night set in when they were on their way home. They could rely on the white ice and snow and the dim moonlight to find their way back to the assault camp.

Tom Dickey (via email to Salisbury) - 19 Jan 2004

We only had the 4 of us. We had a few porters bring some stuff to base, but they all left. No one was hurt.

I don't recall when we got to base - probably early Sept. The weather was bad for a long time, and we were storm bound for a couple of weeks, so we left for a while. I had guiding commitments and had to meet my clients. The three of them went up to the Gokyo region to do some ""trekking."" I don't know what they did. They then returned and John Ball and Tom Curtis did an alpine ascent of the North Face (the first) over several days. I seem to recall it was 3 days, up 2 down - going down the NE Ridge with much difficulty. Trevor tried a different route with a Japanese guy left of the NE Ridge but didn't get very high. Trevor disappeared in the Annapurna Sanctuary with his girlfriend a few years later.
  
I tried the face the spring (May) before that alpine style with Steve Ruoss, after his attempt on the NE Ridge with Jim Traverso, Geoff Tabin and Dave Dossiter. We got a little way up the face (1/3?) before getting stormed off; we were almost swept off and down the runnel we were in, but managed to get down.

Similarly, the Nepalese summiters have been identified as Ang Dorje Sherpa, a 27-year-old sirdar from Sankhuwasabha district and 25-year-old Gelbu Sherpa from Khotang district.

The four had started from the C2 at the height of 5900m at 06:00 hrs on Sep 4 and spent 20 minutes at the peak. They hoisted the national flags of Nepal and the Republic of Korea at the summit and took photographs. They started descending at 08:00 hours and reached the base camp at 14:00 hours.

Health of all the successful climbers is reported to be good.
The expedition is led by 31-year-old primary school teacher Shin Jho-Jin.

Messner believes they are the two men missing on Makalu II in 1985 autumn French team.

Successfully completed water supply project and plant collection plus good experience.

British Kirat Chuli:

Expedition's attempts to climb Kirat Chuli and Nepal Peak now abandoned. Expedition defeated by extremely bad weather, deep snow and avalanche conditions high on mountain.

Williams/Kefford/Spencer reached 22,100 ft on South Ridge of Nepal Peak on 15 Oct before withdrawing and cold.

16th Oct plan to occupy C3 below Nepal Peak abandoned due combined bad weather and thick snow.

Letter from Royal Force Mountaineering Association - Jan 1986

AMA Expedition to Nepal 1985 by Chris Cordery. Chris Cordery represented RAFMA on last year's AMA expedition to Nepal. The expedition lasted for nearly 3 months and amongst its several items it included attempts on Nepal Peak and Kirat Chuli. These 2 mountains are satellites of Kangchenjunga and are linked by a mile long, knife-edged ridge. They had only been climbed once before, from the Sikkim side. The walk-in took 3 weeks before we were ready to mount our assaults on the mountain. Ideas of climbing a new route via the North Col were quickly quashed when a recce showed the vast distance and desperately difficult glacier to be beyond the ability of our team. We settled for the South Col route which had previously been climbed in 1939. The weather remained fine throughout the last 2 weeks of September and we made good progress. We established ABC on the glacier beneath Nepal Peak and we put C1, at 19,500 ft, in a snow basin just below a ridge leading to the summit. The route to C2 proved to be difficult, long and quite prone to avalanches, but after sitting out several days of bad weather we established 6 climbers at 21,500 ft. The news of 5 Indians dying on Everest only 50 miles away did nothing positive for our morale but our lead climbers continued to press on. They got to within 600 ft of the top of Nepal Peak before being driven back to C2 by deep snow and high winds. The next days consisted of a blizzard and winds of 100 mph which demolished several tents or buried them in snow. The route from C2 to C1 had become seriously avalanche-prone and retreats were made in desperate conditions to the relative safety of our 2 BCs. The expedition was very lucky indeed to get everyone back alive. Avalanches had ripped out our fixed ropes and there was not enough time to rebuild our route so it was decided to end our expedition.

An unusually severe storm on Oct 16 trapped them just below Sherpani Col. They suffocated to death when their tents collapsed under the weight of 3 meters of new snow.

2 members failed to return from BC to KTM; it is assumed they perished in the deep snow of West Col-Sherpani Col region.

Report of Mary E. Leung - 30 Oct 85

Oct 18 the three members of Langtang Lirung climbing party (Newell, Spake and Gyalzen) decided to come back to BC due to bad weather. They had been on the mountain since Oct 13. On 16 the weather again turned bad, continuing until Oct 20.

The morning they decided to come down it was also raining. The route from which they were descending was one we had not observed them climbing on before.

The members at BC including cook, kitchen boy, mailrunner, porter and sirdar Urkien Norbu saw three objects carried down by an avalanche. At the time of the avalanche they were at an altitude of approx 16,000 ft. They fell to an altitude of about 12,385 ft.

Immediately after the avalanche we went to the site. The sirdar and a few others saw a jacket sleeve, most probably of Elliot or Gyalzen, an ice axe and one mattress pad. We weren't able to approach them to offer assistance because of constant avalanching. After about 45 minutes we left the site to go back to BC. The rest of that day we were unable to go back because of constant eminent avalanching due to the falling rain and snow. The following day Oct 19, several BC members tried to go back to the site twice, but were unable to do anything because of the danger of more avalanching and a lack of digging implements. Snow and fog were quite heavy that day.

Oct 20 was a sunny clear day. We finished same digging tools out of wood and in the afternoon the BC members tried to dig where they had seen the items before but were unsuccessful. The snow was too deep after two days and nights of snowfall and avalanching.

On Oct 21 we departed BC to return to KTM. We were unable to recover any bodies or equipmment on the mountain since none of the BC members were equipped for high altitude climbing. Nor were we able to determine if they were abandoning the expedition or merely coming down to BC to wait for good weather.",Fatal accident of two members and 1 Sherpa,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2452120,

Were exhausted from carrying loads and feared snow conditions on mountain impossible. Dumped some gear and much food at col and left col on 7th Sept.

With continuing snowfall, could have gotten trapped in BC area.

Toyed with idea of northern approach but did not make actual request for permission because of lack of time and funds and still snowing.

Todd left team about 24 Sept because of miserable conditions apparently.

The Northeast Face of Ama Dablam Expedition Report by Carlos Buhler

Ama Dablam is among the most striking peaks on earth; a sheer, glistening tooth reaching 22,349 ft above sea level. My first view of the mountain was in April 1980, as I struggled to the summit of nearby Baruntse. Of all the peaks I could see on the jagged Himalayan skyline. Ama Dablam stood out. Its modest size, by Himalayan standards, was more than compensated for by its matchless profile.

In Oct, 1984, Michael Kennedy agreed to join me on this two person adventure. Within his comprehensive slide collection, we came up with our first and only photograph of the face. It was a view from fives miles away and did not show the bottom third of the mountain. But with this photograph, and a tremendous spirit of adventure, we departed on Oct 24, 1985 for KTM, Nepal.

Accompanying us on the 120-mile approach were Michael's wife, Julie, my mother, Julie Dougherty, and my brother, Roman. With such a closely knit group, here could hardly have been a better way to prepare for the unknown.

Well looked after by our Sherpa staff, we arrived in BC on Nov 20th. Our first view of the face was one we will never forget. We were sure there was a possible route to the summit; the paramount question, however was whether the winter weather and snow conditions would allow for a safe ascent.

We acclimatized as fully as possible by ascending Kala Pattar with all the family members and Island Peak accompanied by Michael's wife, Julie, before wishing them a safe return journey to KTM. After two days of rest, we moved up to an advanced camp at 16,400 ft beneath the North Ridge of Ama Dablam.

Our exploration of the Northeast Face's lower gullies and slopes during the next two days convinced us that a route was, indeed, feasible. On Nov 30 we set off with seven days of food and fuel and bivouacked at a small cache we had left the day before, at the start of the steepening wall.

Over the next seven days we enjoyed only about for hours of sun each morning. The temperature dropped well below 0 degrees during the shaded afternoons, and we found ourselves straining to keep our body core temperatures high enough to climb.

The terrain was predominantly snow and ice, interspersed with short bands of thin, delicate ice cover steep snow ribs we followed in the center of the face. Good bivouacs were essential, allowing us to consume enough fluids and calories to ward off frostbite, high altitudes illness and general exhaustion.

At 10:30 am Dec 7, we reached the summit of Ama Dablam. Despite some scary winds early in the morning, it turned into a perfectly clear, calm day. We photographed the spectacular peaks surrounding us for 45 minutes, and then began our descent of the Southwest Ridge. Utilizing some fixed ropes that had been left in place during the fall season, as well as those of a New Zealand team attempting a winter ascent of that route, we reached 17,000 feet on the same day. The next morning, Ang Jangbu and his father, Norbu, met us with prayer scarves, food and walking shoes for the hike down to their home in the Sherpa village of Pangboche.

That night, sheltered in the caccoon of warm Sherpa household, exhaustion from the past week's mental and physical pressure was overshadowed by an immense inner feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment. Slowly, the realization of our dreams began to dawn on us. We had done it: we had explored a new route, in winter, to the summit of Ama Dablam.",,1st ascent of NE Face,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2452172,

The Iwa-to-Yuki 

The author and Yasuhira made an alpine-style ascent of Manaslu in Dec 1985. This was the second winter ascent, following that of the Poles. Yamada climbed K2 in July and Everest in Oct, both without oxygen, and then made elaborate plans for the perfect alpine-style ascent of Manaslu. Yamada and Saito helicoptered to Sama on Dec 2nd to join the sirdar and loads, having caravaned beforehand. BC was made on Dec 5th. They set about climbing next day, but the weather deteriorated three days later and forced them to retreat from 7200m. Taking one day's rest at BC, they later resumed activity and after three bivouacs reached the summit at 11:40 am, Dec 13th.

Watters - 13 May 1987

April 25, Watters 15 minutes behind other 3 headed to C4, heard shouting and waving arms below at ABC turned back and found there 2 Chinese officials who asked for climbing permit. Watters went for it (and told to other 3 to go on up); then was asked for trekking permit and as he got it out, Chinese saw passport and took it and both permit (also took Chilean documents but not passports).

Chinese wanted him to come down with them to Chinese army camp near Austrian's BC. Pretended to follow Chinese but actually suddenly went south and left Chinese. Other 3 kept on up: Baker, Grant and Swanson. When they came down, were not caught by Chinese (Baker very early in morning, other 2 in storm).

See AAJ (1988) for further details of confrontation with Chinese officials.","Tent fire at C5 burned Baker's hands slightly; Gerhauser ill (chest cold) and left expedition early when didn't recover (reached C1 once, was down below BC couple of times, finally left May 2)",,Mountain Adventure,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2452773,

Had permit for East Ridge before came to Kathmandu. In February took flight over area and decided too great danger of many seracs making constant passage through area below and also of avalanches. After arrival at BC sent 1 member and LO to Kathmandu and obtained permit for SE Ridge, same route as Yugoslavs. In early May 16 tried to put C4 at 7500m or 7600m, but wind prevented this (an in earlier days, also deep snow); so managed to dump supplies at 7300m. Decided on 14 May not to attempt C4 but go directly from C3 to Lhotse Shar. Very early May decided traverse not possible because:

  (1) were late on mountain
  (2) winds, which were factor in being late in their progress

Say Yugoslavs had come one month earlier and still only in C3. Also 3 traverses too difficult for relatively inexperienced French members. 

1st attempt for summit 17th May from C3 by Flematti, Sharma and Pasang Sherpa; when reached SE Ridge 8200m found wind too strong and decided to fix rope only and down to BC. 

On 18th Gramond went to deposit and then when little wind got to 8200m alone; then ridge dangerous and he did not want to continue solo and to C3. 

19th evening Tedeschi, Esteve, Royer and Sange Sherpa to C3 and awoke at 10:00 pm and started up at 11:45 pm. At 7600m Esteve and Royer turned back because frostbite threatening then and now there were no fixed rope. Sange stopped ascent at 8250m because he was afraid of ridges dangers. Tedeschi continued to top alone and to C3 very tired (to BC on 21st). 

On 22nd Mailly, Nima Norbu and Kikami Sherpa tried for top from C3; Kikami to 7400m (tired) and Mailly, Nima Norbu to 7600m (wind and cold). Climb finished: all members very tired and all camps empty of food and gas supplies.

8 May Esteve and Grammond (pilot and passenger respectively) flew from C3 (7000m) to near BC at about 5300m (NE of BC in parachute like a glider). 1st time from such altitude by this type of parachute.

Had obtained permit to climb East Ridge, but after aerial view of this ridge, team decided it was exposed to too much danger from avalanching and many seracs overhanging route they would have to follow. They sent a member and their liaison officer to Kathmandu to get permission for the Yugoslav's SE Ridge route. (They had also planned to make a traverse from Lhotse Shar to Lhotse's main summit via the unclimbed intermediate summit at the mountain, and traverse would be too difficult for the relatively inexperienced French members.) Between 6th and 13th May, team tried four times to pitch a C4 at 7500-7600m, but first deep snow and then winds prevented this. On the 14th they decided to go directly from C3 to the Lhotse Shar summit. Four attempts were made to reach this peak, but only one member of the third party succeeded because of strong winds, threatened frostbite and fear of the dangers on the ridge.",,1st French ascent; 1st parachute; 1st French army ascent of 8000m on summit,Sherpa Trekking Service (STS),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2452793,

Expedition/Leonpo Gang by Cho Seok-Phil

The other route toward Langshisa Glacier, opposite side of East Ridge, was only once attempted by an English expedition team 30 years ago, but, regretably, 3 members of them happened to die in avalanche. After that accident, our approach is the first trial through this route.

When enter into the Langshisa Glacier, there exist 3 routes in theory: West Ridge, SW Ridge, West Face and our choice was the West Face.

We established BC on Sept 3, and through an Advance Camp of Sept 3, and moved up to a Deposit Camp on Sept 15 on the way to approach. The climbing to Leonpo Gang really came in earnest.
Parties were completely divided for climbing and support, and the climbing pary decided to proceed with the alpine style.

In the face of pressing dangers from avalanche of ice and snow as well as collapse in spots, we had great difficulties in this West Face route. To minimize the risks, we had to reduce the time of our staying as short as possible.

The way to C1 was a snow face of 60-80 degree in 500m long, which we named ""The Toh Wang Gil"" after 2 days of climbing by member Lee Jeong-Houn, almost by himself thoroughly, C1 was secured on Sept 19.

Advancing toward C2 was also blocked by more giant slope snow face, named by ""The Haneul"" of 70 degrees in 600 meters long. Struggling through the ice and snowfall, Lee Jeong-Houn overcame this route and then, he established C2 (6200m) of 1 tent on upper band of snow face by using 2 snow bars.

Due to bad weather, all members retreated to the Advance Camp and waited till the weather to be better.

Finally on Sept, members Lee Jeong-Houn and Kim Soo-Hyeon started for a route of attack with 2 Sherpas, Pemba and Gombu. On that day Kim and Pemba arrived at C1 and Lee and Gombu came up to C2 at 5:00 pm and then, the four established C3 (6650m) on Sept 26.

It was Sunday Sept 27. After 2 hours from C3, they all 2 members and 2 Sherpas climbed up to the summit at last at 8:15 am. Even all the members of expedition were unexperienced with the Himalayan mountains though, they have achieved a real remarkable success - the first summit through the West Face route of Leonpo Gang.",None except one Sherpa sprained foot; another Sherpa bad cough and left expedition,,Adventure Nepal,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2452968,

Camped one night before pass, one night on Nangpa Glacier, crossed Nangpa La 29th Oct and camped around the corner (to E). 30th Oct were at traditional C1 on Tichy route and camped there. 1st Nov Berg took rest day at 21,800 ft just below Hillary's icefall in 1952, while Mark Udall and Gustke (these 2 were exhausted and very cold) they returned met other 2 and all 4 descended to 21,800 ft. Berg kept on up to highest point (""about as alpine-style a climb as you can make it""). No fixed lines. From 10 days carried all gear they had. Berg climbed 5000 ft in 8 hrs 45 minutes, broke his own trail, reached 21,800 ft at 2:30 pm, had to erect tent collapsed by winds that had actually made ascent possible by blowing away snow. All 5 returned to Namche on 6th Nov (in Thami midnight of 5th and woke up tea shopkeeper for boiled potatos). Were unsupported on this adventure and Berg especially so.

So tried another approach and on this appeared difficult section above. They went to C1 for rest and storm hit and it ended all thought of discovering whether section above was negotiable. Big snowstorm hit 18-20 Oct and had to dig for 3 days to keep tents Ok and to ferry loads to place below BC. 

Climbing route: South Arrete/Ridge and South Spur, well west of Polish route.

Our own base went up on the 14th and Camp 1 was in place by the 17th and then the bombardment began. Twenty four hours later we were under 4 ft of snow and spent the next couple of days digging out, rather than in.

Jannu Expedition Francaise, by Henri Sigayret

Ascent 

From Ghunsa to BC 1:
Tuesday October 20th:

Beautiful weather. We had some porters with some yaks. We had had snow at about 4000m high. At base camp 1 there was 50 cm of snow which had been settled by the sun.

BC 1 is the usual camp of expeditions on that side. In particular, it is that of the French expedition of 1962. It is located near a moraine lake on a grass space; it is very comfortable. The height is about 4500m.

The sirdar has thought it possible to have the expedition gear carried until base camp 1. We have also set up a further camp, i.e., base camp 2 [ABC].

Date: Oct 22nd:

It is situated in the middle of the Yamatri glacier. Its height is about 4800m. There is no difficulty between BC 1 and BC 2. From basecamp 1, one follows the lake on the south side, one goes down the moraine (very steep - be aware of stone falls). Then one goes up again easily the glacier.

In general there is water. There are small lakes, and some small glacial streams.

From BC 2 to C1:
Date: Oct 23rd:

All the team, besides Gerard Auger, went up to C1. 

Route: one follows the Yamatri glacier then one crosses it to go on the moraine which is alongside the Youngster's Spur. One then goes up the moraine, then, through a small corridor, one crosses on the right. Then one goes up a little to a shelf near some big blocks. This is on the right bank of the A Glacier. The altitude is about 5300m. No difficulty is to be found. We placed the tents on Oct 23 and Oct 24th. All the team goes down to BC.

Attempt on the Youngster's Spur:
Date: 25/26th Oct

An ice corridor may be seen in the middle of the Youngster's Spur. It's facing south and its foot is near C1. Its gradient is about 40 to 45 degrees, but in some points it may reach 60 degrees or more. In its upper part, it meets the ridge of the Youngster's Spur (passages are steeper). The Youngster's Spur is mixed: there are ice passages, cornices - rock passages. This spur is climbed with several lengths of rope.

The spur has been equipped by Elisabeth Julliard, Henri Sigayret, Frederic Vallet and Michel Vincent. Frederic Vallet is head-man in this part.

Beyond Point B, the ridge is snowed in. There is drifting snow and mushrooms cornices. Too much gear and too many days would be necessary to equip this ridge. The head team decided to find a new route which meets the French one. The team climbed down and took off the material which equipped the ridge and the corridor. The descent was done without any problems.

From C1 to the French route
Tuesday Oct 27th:

Dawa Sherpa and Mane Bahadur are head-man on the glacier. Its heavy going. They are followed by Elisabeth Juliard and Henry Sigayret, then by Frederic Vallet and Michel Vincent. Some days later the other members of the team reached C2.

A traverse, then a direct climbing up on a steep glacier (but without any difficulty) enabled the team to meet the rock ridge behind which the French route stands. One goes up a glacier (it is magnificient). The crossing on seracs in dangerous. One gets through an almost vertical passage in a serac (a fixed rope has been installed) on to the glacier shelf in front of an enormous crevasse (15 to 20m wide), which bounds the valley.

A rope system which joins the two edges of the crevasse may still be seen. (Perhaps was it left by the Spanish expedition). 

Installation of C2 - probable height 6000m.
Michel Vincent and Mane Bahadur went down to C1.

Wednesday, Oct 28th:

Days rest at C1 but for one of us who stayed at BC.

Thursday Oct 29th:

Elisabeth Julliard, Mario Paffumi, Henri Sigayret, Frederic Vallet slept at C2.

Friday, Oct 30th:

Michel Vincent joins the above team. Loads were carried to the Youngster's pass. The equipment of the first part of the ridge is done, until the foot of the ""Buttress Head."" The ridge is sometimes overhanging but without major difficulties.

Saturday, Oct 31st:

C3 is installed. Frederic Vallet as head-man equipped the remaining part of the ridge toward the Buttress Head. C3 is installed just under it. Michel Vincent, Elisabeth Julliard and Henri Sigayret followed F. Vallet and all of them installed C3.

Tuesday, Nov 3rd:

Elisabeth Julliard, Henri Sigayret, Frederic Vallet, Michel Vincent left C2. They carried the gear for an attempt to the summit (tents, ropes, food, gas). They slept at C3.

Wednesday, Nov 4th (camp 3):

The four mountaineers left for C4. The Buttress Head has been reached rapidly. Then we crossed down toward the foot of the Lace Ridge. At the foot of this ridge strong blast of wind and clouds prevent the mountaineers from going up. A tent has been installed. Bivouac.

Thursday, Nov 5th:

The wind was less strong. We went up the Lace Ridge, then crossed the throne glacier. We climbed up the glacier until 7000m (its the foot of the ice face which leads to the ridge which is the remainder of the ascent).

- In the Lace Ridge: some passages are steep and very steep
- Throne Glacier:    easy but tiresome.

The four mountaineers are in their tent at C4.

Friday, Nov 6:

It has been decided to attempt to reach the summit directly from C4. Unfortunately, we go up too late. We left at about 8:30. We climbed up the ice slope where the French set up their C6 in 1962 (no fixed rope has been installed).

Above this camp, at the end of the very fine ridge Elisabeth Julliard and Henri Sigayret decided to turn back. It is 2 am. They started to have frostbites. The wind was blowing strongly. We had no extra ropes. (Both roped parties used 7 mm ropes). They went down to C4 being roughly handled by the wind.

Frederic Vallet and Michel Vincent went on to the summit. They came back at night and they reached C4 at 11 pm. The four mountaineers had frostbites.

Saturday, Nov 7th:

Frederic Vallet and Michel Vincent came down to C2. Elisabeth Julliard and Henri Sigayret slept at C3 which they cleared the following day.

Sunday, Nov 8th:

All the four mountaineers, the two Sherpas, Dawa and Mane, who were at C2 went down to the upper base camp.

Monday, Nov 9th:

All the team headed toward Ghunsa.

Some Comments

The Youngster's Spur: this spur would have required some extra gear, more time, and another head roped party.

The route that we took: the French route of 1962 is a very difficult route; in case of bad weather it may be dangerous to turn back for a light team and if the route is not equipped properly.

This route is beautiful. The only dangerous passage is situated under C2 (passage in the seracs). This passage is rather short.",None,,Rover Treks,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453008,

Tried for 1 week to climb W Ridge. Snowstorm 18-20th Oct made team descended to BC and waited there for it. Had to make new route in deep snow. 25th Oct from C3 to Firnkopf (named by Austrians in 1954, means snow hat) at 6630m and turned back to C3. 26th to BC. Porters ordered for 27th and left BC 27th. Had lost some time on approach march: expected it to take 8 days but took 14 days. This route easiest to climb Saipal from south but would take 2 more weeks via W Col. In to Saipal's immediate route: no avalanche danger even after snowfall via this route to Firnkopf. Returned from BC via Kandha and Dhuli to Chainpur from where flew to KTM on scheduled flight. Fixed 50m rope between C1 and C2 on glacier and 50m more from C2 to C3 on glacier.

Remaking route was difficult because of many crevasses covered by powder snow.


Following is from a letter to E. Hawley from Franz Kroell:

In 1987 we went to Nepal with the permit for climbing Saipal from the south: 2nd of October we start in Kathmandu (by plane to Pokhara, with lorry to Phurbe). From Phurbe (5th October) by foot (end of the road) to Chainpur (possible by plane) and to the BC 17th of October). 18th - 20th of October we climbed on the SW Face of Saipal up to 6200m (steep; rotten rock).

Then we focused our interest to the opposite side, to the West Ridge from Westlicher Firnkopf (Western Firnkopf) to Ostlicher Firnkopf (Eastern Firnkopf). The height of these two mountains is correct in your map (Austrian Saipal Expedition about 1950; Rudolph Jonas, Vienna).

On 25th of October we climbed Westlicher Firnkopf (Fritz Mross, Germany; Ang Chopal, Nepal; Franz Kroell, Austria). We climbed from BC up an easy icefall, crossed this icefall and climbed up to the main ridge and followed exact the ridge to the very top of Westlicher Firnkopf. We stopped climbing on the summit and did not follow the ridge to Ostlicher Firnkopf and to Saipal.

The climb up to Westlicher Firnkopf is an easy climb (Grade I and II/UIAA ice and snow up to 65 degrees, short fixed sections with few meters of rope crossing the glacier. 

Far more difficult is the walk in to BC, especially the last three days. Its extremely difficult to find a trail for the porters; bears and mountain sheep are living near BC.

There are some existing routes to climb Mt. Saipal:
  West Face of Saipal (Spanish)
  West Ridge (over Westlicher and Ostlicher Firnkopf)
  NE Ridge 
  (Maybe SE Ridge, East Face??)

We climbed Saipal in the autumn of 1990 by the NE Ridge, flying to Simikot and walking in by Chala and the Kherang Khola to BC.",Sopka stomach trouble only,Reached point known as Westlicher Firnkopf on W Ridge (unknown if Jonas' Austrian team reached this point in 1954),International Trekkers (Intrek Asia),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2452991,

Final Expedition Report - Dec 4, 1987

Report of Safety Conditions and Reports from other Post Monsoon Expeditions.

Chronology of Approach - Sept 29 Clay Wadman flew KTM to Lukla. Nov 3 Todd Bibler, Eric Reynolds, Sandy Stewart and Michael Dimitri flew to Lukla. On Nov 6 these five members banded together in Namche Bazar. Meanwhile, on Nov 6 Annie Whitehouse left KTM to Jiri by bus with 11 trekkers. She was leading a trek to Kalapattar. The group of five climbers proceded to Pheriche on the 10th of Nov. Our original plan and permit called for an attempt on Tawoche (6542m). Several days routes and conditions on Tawache made, on Nov 14-16. Plans for an ascent of Tawoche were abandoned as it was clearly unsafe. On Nov 17 the team decided to move on to our second objective, the ascent of Ama Dablam (6856m). First, we moved to Mingbo base camp on Nov 18-19. Then our intention was to conduct a reconnaissance of the route on Ama Dablam, in the hope of discovering safer conditions than on Taweche. Since we had already at this point forfeited our Tawoche permit and it looked like a similar situation was on Ama Dablam, all members were discouraged.

Immediately upon arrival in Nepal we heard about the huge 2-meter snowstorm of late October. Enroute to Pheriche we had the chance to meet and talk first hand to members of five expeditions to peaks in the near vicinity of our objectives. (South Face of Nuptse, South Face of Lhotse Shar, Ama Dablam North Ridge, Ama Dablam NW Ridge and Ama Dablam SW Ridge). All these expeditions had failed and had retreated in the face of many avalanches, deep unconsolidated snow, and the belief and these were among the most serious and dangerous conditions they had encountered. We also, of course, were very discouraged and saddened to hear of the deaths of twelve climbers and trekkers in the Khumbu and an additional ten in nearby Tibet - all as a result of the big storm and resulting conditions.

Todd Bibler and Sandy Stewart on the 14th to 16 on Nov found several approaches to Tawoche to have deep unconsolidated granular snow. This type of snowpack is familiar to us as being a particularly dangerous condition, know as temperature gradient snow. Several of the expedition members have Professional Avalanche Forecasting experience in Colorado. We have seen these type of conditions there frequently associated with major avalanches and also know that it is a condition that can take many weeks, even months, to stablize. To make conditions for climbing even more hazardous in our opinion was a period of sunny weather which causes a thin melted smooth glaze to appear on the surface of the snowpack. In this case, even a snowfall from a new storm or windblown snow, can cause avalanche as it is such a smooth sliding surface.

Summary of Ascent Details - Because of the above conditions we approached the mountain with great care, respect and even fear. On Nov 20 Sandy Stewart and Eric Reynolds as one party and Todd Bibler and Michael Dimitri as a second party left Mingbo base camp (15,000 ft) with full loads to break a trail through deep snow to C1. As our BC was lower than that used by many, we were faced about 10 km of hard trudging. We intended to cache loads and prepare the route for a later ascent. On the 21st of Nov, Michael and Todd descended because of Michael's feeling of illness. Stewart and Reynolds continued route preparation from C1 to C2. Upon reaching C2 they observing high winds blowing off the summits of the Thamserku and Kangtega, as well as ""meretails"" and large lenticular clouds building on the summit of Mt. Everest. Both knew from previous Nepal and MT Everest experience that this almost always meant a storm approaching. Believing that this strong wind would destroy any possibility of a safe ascent they decided to go for the summit as quickly as possible.

C3 was established by Stewart and Reynolds at 20,500 ft on Nov 22. They climbed to the summit and returned for another night at C3 on Nov 23. (It is important to say that the summit day of climbing is very steep and that there is no chance to belay or use safety anchors. Because of this it is especially vulnerable to the surface glaze avalanche conditions we described).

Meanwhile, Annie Whitehouse had arrived at Mingbo BC, having been delayed by poor road conditions to Jiri and the evacuation of an ill trekker. On Nov 23 Wadman and Whitehouse left BC and acclimatized a night on open snowfields at 17,000 ft. On the 24th Stewart and Reynolds met Wadman to immediately go on towards the summit because of the continuing threatening weather conditions. Ropes were in place, camp platforms dug, and key supplies left behind (tent, stove, food) to aid them. On Nov 25 Whitehouse and Wadman made their camp 3 at 20,000 ft. On 26th they summited at noon in very cold, windy extreme conditions. Their descent to BC was made on the 27th.

Todd Bibler seeing the deteriorating weather conditions made a bold quick solo ascent on the 25th and 26th.

Moved very fast towards top and reached summit at 6 pm (found empty oxygen bottle only, no poles. Went all way aroud rim of volcano-like structure).

Wants next climb also solo on 8000er: ""I don't like to climb with people.""

This was the first winter solo ascent of any 8000er and the first solo of Cho Oyu.

Garrido crossed the Nangpa La from Nepal into Tibet and scaled the standard (Tichy) route entirely alone from his C1 at 5850m on the Gyabrag Glacier near the site of advance base camps for many teams starting from within Tibet. Two Nepalis had helped him establish and stock C1, and one of them remained in that camp to take photos with a long lens while Garrido made his summit push. He started up on 2nd Feb, climbed to his C2 at 6400m to where he alone had previously carried its gear, and slept there two nights, waiting for the winds to abate. On the 4th he moved up with a tent to 7000m and slept there, and on the 5th tried to go to the summit. But he had made too late a start on the 5th (he did not move till 9:00 am) and went to only 7600m before retreatng to C3 at 7000m. On the 6th he left C3 at 7:30 am, took no tent, food or fuel but only a sleeping bag, which he left at 7600m. From there he continued up with only a camera, headlamp and one ice axe. He moved very fast towards the summit, went all the way around the summit rim to make sure he reached the very highest point, which he reached at about 6:00 pm. In his descent, although it was now getting dark, he could follow his own tracks until he reached a rock barrier, where he had trouble finding his way. He had fixed no rope, but managed at 10:00 pm to find his sleeping bag and bivouaced at 7600m. It was very windy all the day and the wind continued throughout the night, but he had protection from the rock, and the temperature was not extremely low; he did not get frostbitten. On the 7th he went down only as far as C3 at 7000m because of exhaustion, but on the 8th he rejoined his Sherpa at C1.

Route above C2 was new and to left of Bonington route: Bonington team was on ridge but ""that ridge's left which was a little risky"" because of soft ice/hard snow. Difficult climbing was from C3 to C4 because very steep rock and loose rock and often stonefall. 45-50 fixed ropes of 50m from C1 to mini-rockband at 7700m; made route from C4 to mini-rockband in 2 days with about 400m rope here, then to top. 20th Dec 3 men left C2 at 3:40 am and Seagusa at 6 am because headlamp broken and he waited for daylight, joined others at 7700m at 9:40 am; above 7700m slow going (fixed only one rope).

The route was basically the Bonington route of spring 1970, but above C2 at 6100m. Bonington's ridge was ""very bad"" because of loose powdered snow, so team took a couloir to its left; the couloir itself was a ""little risky"" because of soft ice/hard snow which was difficult to climb. They rejoined Bonington route at section of all was very steep rock between C3 and C4 (6850m and 7400m); rock was unstable and loose pieces were frequently falling, injuring a member and a Sherpa. The site of C3 was changed twice because of stone fall and snow avalanches. No bottled oxygen was used because their entire supply was in C1 and was swept away by an avalanche early in the climb.

Kobayashi fell to his death at 7900m. Saito fell just 20 meters above C4. Apparently their falls were caused by fatigue.

Accidents besides the fatal falls and Sato's leg was Sherpa's shoulder and head struck by ice 3 Dec avalanche at C1 which took away all oxygen and much fuel, food and gear; but had 2 months supply of food and fuel and many spare pieces of equipment (but not oxygen).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Had permit for Glacier Dome for acclimatization but made no attempt.

Saegusa had no headlamps so came quickly. Yagihara and Saito down together. 7900m Kobayashi slipped down; maybe snow some places hard and flat and some soft: slipped in bad snow.

Saito very tired; with Yamada on same rope and Yamada at C4 just waited 15 minutes and Saito didn't come. Saegusa saw him fall. Yamada called and Saito answered 2-3 times). Saegusa went to Saito and Saito asked for water and then fell in dark (he had no headlamp); searched but couldn't find him with headlamp.

Planned 2 summit bids but after accident all stopped. 2nd bid to be by Nazuka, Sato and Akuzawa on 22nd Dec.

3rd Dec avalanche lost much equipment and food but no one hurt.

The father of a Spanish climber, Quico Dalmases, came to believe that this body was that of his son who disappeared when he was climbing alone in the autumn of 1989, and the father, Jaon Dalmases, appealed in the spring of 2007 to climbers that season to check various details to identify the body as that of Quico.

Inaki Ochoa, one of the climbers whom Dalmases asked for help, summited Dhaulagiri I on 26 April 2007, said that the body was that of the German on Norbert Joo's team in the spring of 1995.

Chong - 8 Feb 1990

Expedition's printed report says that at 2:00 pm on summit day, the summit party had their last walkie-talkie contact. They said ""there is no big difficulty from here to summit. We are now at a rocky area just below summit and we will reach summit immediately. On the way back from the summit, we will make a bivouac for the night."" They fell at 5:30 pm while coming down after having reached summit.
 
Chong talked with leadership after they returned to KTM. Has no idea where the time of 5:30 pm for their fall came from. Climbing leader told Chong summit was just a few minutes from top and he had no doubt they reached summit. He thought they might have fallen on the Pokhara side of mountain since no trace was found of them or the path of their fall on north side. In their last radio contact they said they would contact next from their bivouac but never did come on radio again.

Chong is Korean mountaineering journalist who runs a lodge in KTM.

Letter from Oswald Oelz - 20 October 1989

The base camp was established at 4750m on September 26th. On the 28th of September we established C1 above the Naike Col at an altitude of approx 5600m. Subsequently there was considerable snowfall; however, on the 3rd of October a preliminary C2 was established at an altitude of approx 6300-6400m. All this was much also a work of our 3 excellent high altitude Sherpas. During the next period there was again some considerable snowfall. On the 10th of October while [returning from?] carring equipment to the planed side of C3 the three high altitude Sherpas got into a huge avalanche at an approx altitude of 6600m. This slab started without without any prior warning signs directly on the tracks of the normal route. Miraculously two of the Sherpas were only partly buried and could rescue themselves. Subsequently they found their sirdar who was rapidly digged out and who was already unconscious. With the help of the American Lapkass of the British/American Expedition who had accompanied our Sherpas and had not been avalanched, they could resuscitate him and eventually all four got back to C2. They were no major injuries, but loss of equipment including one set of a walky-talky. On the following day we accompanied our Sherpas down to base camp and abandoned the expedition due to continued danger of avalanches and time pressure.","Avalanches hit 3 ""Sherpas"" (Tamangs)",,Lamjung,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453849,

From 8th to 25th kept going up to C2, waited for winds to stop and went down again. 3 Austrian ""Sherpas"" and Andy Lapkass were up breaking trail to 22,000 ft; Andy down to C2 and Sherpas coming down when slab 1000 ft high and 500 ft wide and 3 ft thick broke away just below N Col at 22,000 ft, a place where wind comes over N Col and leaves snow. Sherpas went down with it and ended up on tip of it unhurt. Lapkass and one of this team's Sherpas went up to rescue them; very, very lucky no one injured and this avalanche shook up Austrians so much they left 2 days later (18th Oct). This team then skirted ""deposition area"" but now winds had started up. Put 2 tents at C3 and slept one night, but wind so strong no question of making summit bid next day: Both Burgesses, Moores and Lapkass had intended to go to top from this camp and back within a day. Went down and waited for winds to ease. New plan for Burgesses and Lapkass to C2, from C2 overnight to summit (spending night in shaking tent useless) with winds not so strong at night; but at C2 on 2nd Nov winds were fierce. High BC, where Austrians had been, was devastated by huge ice cliff broken off by earthquake 20th Oct. This expedition's depot at this site was translocated and would have been catastrophic if occupied.

A crevasse below C2 was opening at route of 8 inches/day and was 20 feet wide by end of expedition; another reason abandoned climb because of this danger on edge of couloir that has to be crossed between C1 and C2; ladders have now became necessary for this area.

The normal NE Face route was a dangerous place to be: a great slab of snow 300m high, 150m wide and one meter thick broke away at about 6700m, a few hundred meters below North Col (in an area that is often avalanched), and carried another team's Sherpas with it; with great luck, no one injured.  About two days later, an earthquake dislodged a huge ice cliff which devastated the area around high base camp and would have killed anyone in it (no one was there at the time).  A crevasse below camp 2 at about 6000m kept opening at the rate of about 20 centimeters per day, was 6 meters wide when this team abandoned their climb chiefly because of fierce winds.","Avalanche carried 3 Austrian ""Sherpas"" down 1000 ft (uninjured)",,Tawache,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453864,

Information to be reported to the Ministry of Tourism after the completion of Expedition:

We started from KTM to Lukla on 30th Aug. We reached at BC on 6th Sept and at the same day we established BC on 5200m. We started climbing on 10th Sept and established C1 on 13th Sept at the height of 5600m and 2nd Camp on 16th Sept at the height of 6200m and 3rd camp on 28th Sept at the height of 6800m and Camp 4th on 5th Oct at the height of 7100m and C5 on 8th Oct at the height of 7800m and C6 established by Jerzy Kukuczka (leader) and Ryszard Pawlowski on 21 Oct at the height of 7800m and on 22nd Oct they established the first biv at the height of 7900m and slept there and on 23rd Oct they reached at the height of 8300m and established the next biv and slept there.

On 24th Oct they planned to got to summit and at the same day at 8:30 o'clock early in the morning they started their climbing from 8300m to summit. Kukuczka was climbing and he ascended approx 70m from the last biv. After a few minutes he fell down slightly at 9:00 o'clock from 8350m. After that he was falling down quickly as the rope had been broken near the last biv and he fell down badly one hundred and forty meters and he was dead. At that time the next member Pawlowski was near the last biv, when leader was falling down. Pawlowski was just behind of it when the rope was broken before him and he got protected.

So, after that Pawlowski never went up and abandoned his climbing and at the same time he started coming down and at that time he came down and slept at 7900m and on 25th Oct at 11:15 am he arrived at C5, where other two members [Kopys and Pawlikowski] were living at that camp for their rescue. He arrived at C5 and informed to BC about all the accident. So, at the same day at 4:00 pm. I informed about the accident in details to Ministry of Tourism. All three members camp to C4 and slept at that day. The next day they arrived at BC. Other members in BC at 10:00 o'clock morning on 26th Oct, went to the glaciers to search the dead body and after sometime they found the dead body of leader in a crevasse at the height of 5400m. They could tell from his clothing that it was the dead body of a leader. They left it there in the crevasse. On the next day on 27th Oct.

Mr. Yang of the Korean Alpine Federation reported to Jurgalski that Hong and Lee told him [Yang] that they did not summit.


Initial Report (later changed, see below):

Went up mountain via Messner route, i.e., did not cross Nangpa La (Mingma Norbu of Karikhola was on this expedition and also Messner's in 1983) and like Messner descended normal route which meant crossing Nangpa La from north side. All members and Sherpas followed same route; some Sherpas met people from this expedition on normal route from Tibet: this Korean expedition's C3 was next to USA and Italian C2; it was at C3 that Koreans joined normal route. All the way to C3 route was on glacier without snow; at C4 was deep snow. 

Wangel knows Messner route from Mingma Norbu, who was on this climb and also with Messner.

5 Sept 2 members and 1 Sherpa high porter from C4 and biv at 8050m at foot of couloir in only biv sack, 1 piece of chocolate, no food or fuel. Some stonefall and ice particles coming down couloir, broke Hong's goggles and slightly pains, very faint but leader ordered them to summit and on they went to summit. Left biv 6:00 am 6th and on top after 8:40 minutes climb. Oxygen supplies arrived late at BC while climbers already high and weather very good. 8 Sept weather turned bad with wind and sometimes snow. 6 Sept summiters sleep C3 with other members and Sherpas (no people or provisions in C4) - and ""almost dire"" with weakness and hunger: next day C1. No more attempts for summit. Difficulties between C1 and C2 where crevasses need fixed rope (740m); C2 and C3 same stone and icefall. Used snow route all the way; no fixed rope in couloir.

At 1:45 summiter Hong, thought he was at summit but when cloud disappeared realized not highest point and went onto to true summit in clear weather.

Cho Oyu Expedition, Korean Autumn 1989 - by Kwak Gyu-Youl

The expedition member was ten persons led by Park Sang-Yul. They started for Kathmandu on July 22. Starting up caravan at Jiri on August 2. BC was established at 5200m on August 17. 

C1 was established at 5950m under the Nangpa La. They ascended the so-called traditional SW Ridge from Nepal, which is in actual the NW Ridge. C2, C3 and C4 were established at 6300m, 6700m and 7500m on Aug 22, 29 and 30. 

On Aug 31, Dong-Yon Lee, Gyong-Pyo Hong, Sirdar Wangel started for the summit at 3 am, but descended on the first rock band at 1:50 pm. They arrived at C4 at 6:20 pm.

On September 1, they started at 7:15 am and established a tent at 8100m which is the highest point arrived the day before. They started at 6:50 am on Sept 2. After 6 hours they arrived at the second rock band with abundant snows.

They have mistaken the summit for heavy fog at 3:23 pm. But when the fog lifted, they found the true higher summit. Since that time about one hour they reached the summit.


Chong - 5 Oct 89
Villa Everest prop.

Korean Cho Oyu team ""confessed"" to Chong just before they left KTM (and his lodge) that they had climbed the normal route, not SW Ridge as claimed at first. Had intended all along to climb Tichy route. They began climbing on 20 Aug and reached summit 2 Sept.


Magda King Nos Loppe & Ang Phuri - 1 Oct 1989

Met Koreans at Spanish ABC 30 Aug. They made summit 2 days later 1 Sept. Spanish had already been in on above Nepal BC 15 days.

Koreans C3 = Spanish C1, just below icefall. Next camp was where Italian woman landed after riding an avalanche 800m. Went up straight up instead of making a left traverse above C2, as Tichy route would have taken them. Sherpa is sure Koreans did not ascend via Messner, did not meet Koreans after their summit day so did not talk with them after it, but are sure Koreans were not at all on the route they claim to have been on. 

""They cannot substantiate their claim with picture because their pictures will show the wrong place"" - King


Zeglen & Bianchi - 25 Sept 1989

Koreans were on normal route and crossed Nangpa La in both directions. Could not have followed route they claimed because very difficult and very dangerous avalanching there. Italians saw no track via Messner approach. They left Cho Oyu across Nangpa La. No Chinese beyond Northern BC = Chinese BC, well away from mountain.

Saw their track very nice track up mountain via Tichy route Koreans on summit 3 Sept - 1st met some at Bianchi's.


Sigi Hupfauer - 20 Sept 1989

Does not believe Koreans could climb new route they claims so quickly especially on such steep face, and altitudes given for camps don't correspond with sketch over Schneider's contours.

Agrees not at all likely Koreans using their tactics of fixed camps and rope made climb of route they claim.

Escoffier: did no real climbing to 7800m, moved with ski poles; had some trouble descending; ""a little disappointed"" but will come to Everest again but on Nepalese side.

On 19th evening (6:00 pm) 3 Koreans (including 2nd leader) and 7 Korean Sherpas came over to Belgium BC to fight: 2nd leader said to Hubert and Maincent, the only Belgian team members in BC, ""I kill you"" and 2 Koreans with sticks and 2 Sherpas with fists attacked Hubert and Maincent. Maincent, who argued and resisted, was more seriously attacked and bled from on temple from stick. Both Hubert and Maincent legs had to use ski poles to help them walk afterwards. When blood seen by Korean's Sherpas they were afraid and when Hubert returned to their camp; fight lasted 1 hour. Hubert and Maincent left BC at 9:30 pm leaving their 2 Sherpas at camp, fearing Koreans would return and again attack in their larger members; reached Gokyo early in morning and then continued on down. ""I never imagined such a thing could happen."" At time of fight, Belgian's party at BC were only Hubert and Maincent and 2 Sherpas; Lane and Nyssens had left on 17th as originally planned they would.

Maincent was tied with a rope around his neck connected to his hands behind his back; he fell over and was able to free his hands from insecure knots.

Team had hoped that big serac wall would not be very dangerous in winter time, which is why they chose to climb in winter season, but constant serac avalanching on SE Face night and day forced abandonment of climb.

Decided to wait for Profit: too dangerous to climb alone on direct route (too dangerous for Batard) and to use Polish route too easy with Polish ropes in place. Profit wanted to climb Polish route, Batard would also and go faster than he. If Profit going top direct route, Batard not interested in climbing with him because Profit slower and it would wear carrying too much gear and summit not possible. Profit, who did not invite Batard to join him, said he was not interested in Polish route. They met at Namche on 1st Dec and Batard did not return to Chhukung; abandoned idea of climb. Batard cannot do what Beghin or Messner (or Kukuczka) can do: climb slowly steadily with heavy load; Batard can only go ""very high and very quick.""

Batard declared he was not interested in following the Polish autumn 1989 route and using their ropes but only in making his own new route more directly to the summit than the Poles line. But he found his direct line too dangerous for a his kind of solo bid and abandoned his attempt after having reached a high point of 7000m in only two days climb.

2. 28th Dec 1 pm from BC, climbed all night up Polish route; reached Polish C4 (7300m) for 1st biv, where arrived 3:30 pm 29th. Big problem with wind, which almost blew tent down face at 3:00 am and had to make snowhole. 30th all day in snowhole because of wind. 31st down to BC starting 4:00 pm when wind abated and reached BC 2:00 am on 1st Jan.

3. 12 Jan from BC 8:30 pm, bottom of face 1:15 pm 13th climbed all night and stopped 7:00 am 13th 5560m because very strong wind. Back to BC same day - Polish route.

4. 19th Jan from BC 10:00 pm, bottom of face 1:30 pm 20th and up very quickly: 7300m at 2:30 pm 20th on Polish route. Slept in snowhole again because of wind. 21st and 22nd night also slept there. 23rd down at 10:00 am, bottom of face 3:00 pm 23rd was in very good condition but impossible to climb in very strong wind.

After Lucas went home, Profit climbed only Polish route for maximum security ""which is very importent for me."" 1st time alone on face was not to reach summit but to carry up supplies. 2nd and 3rd times alone on face were attempts to reach summit.

No falling stones or ice on Polish route, but some to its right. ""Face is very big - 3500 meters. Takes long time to fix rope if you are a big expedition and get very tired.""

  2nd to 7600m
  3rd to 8000m
  4th to top 
  5th to 7300m

Would like to return to Face. In BC late Nov and start climb early Dec - very safe period, no stone, ice good. Would return to Profit-Lucas new route. This time spent days looking at face, deciding route. 

Profit and Lucas attempted the great South Face by a previously untried line to the left of Polish autumn 1989 route, and in 24 hours of continuous climbing gained 2600 vertical meters to bivouac at 6750m. But then they traversed to Poles' fixed ropes and descended when a snowstorm approached. Lucas went home while Profit stayed and went up the face alone three times via the Polish route, for it was much safer for a soloist to use the fixed ropes. His plan was to climb the face in four days bivouacing at 7300m, 7600m and 8000m in the ascent, fourth 7800m. He had to spend two to three hours to overcome difficult section where he kept slipping one or two meters (""this was most difficult problem I had ever encountered and I was afraid I couldn't solve it""). He managed to reach the NE Ridge at 7800m at 3:00 pm on the 10th, when it started to snow.

24 Sept 1996 - Sigi Hupfauer believe the party on the 19th of May did not reach the highest point ""and for me this is not the summit"" - 1/2 hour is not long enough to have gotten to it (he read Porsche's reply).


Liz Hawley - 12 Nov 1996

According to Haerter in June 1900, this expedition sent two parties to the top, but I heard this spring (Spring 1996) that in fact the first party did not go all the way, and this September one of the members of the second party, Sigi Hupfauer, whom I have know for years, confirmed that the first group did not go to the highest point; a member of the first party admitted this earlier this year to another German I know.

BC established on 24th April

After the excitement of KTM and the problems of our hasty departure from the troubles here we are now safely set up in the BC, just a few miles from the mountain. We arrived here together, having met up with Major Kit Spencer, his two Gurkha soldiers, Sarah Arathoon and Mick Kenny at Namche Bazar on the morning of Sunday 22nd April. We saved two days on the walk in from KTM by extending the usual trekking legs and by making use of the excellent weather Nepal is currently enjoying. Further time was made up by reaching BC, from Namche in 2 days instead of 5, the cost of this inevitably was a day of sore heads as we struggled to acclimatise. Fortunately the pain did not last long, except for the leader who was involved in a clinical trial for Boots Pharmaceuticals and obviously drew a very short straw in the selection of painkillers.

Base Camp is sited at 5120m on the moraine above the junction of the Lungsampa and Ngozumba Glaciers. We have spectacular views of Cho Oyu which is 8 kms to the north but can only see the top 800 feet of Gyachung Kang which is hidden by a ridge coming down from Cho Oyu.

Work on the 25th centred on organising our stores and food and on making BC as comfortable as possible for our month-long stay. Kit Spencer, Sarkey (our Sirdar) and Lalit reconnoitered the route from BC across the Lungsampa Glacier and along the moraines on the north side of the Ngozumpa Glacier to find a safe way to the first icefall which guards the route to Gyachung Kang. On the 26th we all ferried our first loads along this route. Glacier travel is always tortuous and although the distance from BC to the first icefall is less than 6 kms it took us 3-1/2 hours to comlete the journey. We carried loads of between 20 and 25 kgs and have established a temporary camp at the foot of the 600m high wall of rock and ice. Last night Andy Hughes and Greg Hill stayed at the camp and today are beginning to find a route through the crazy mass of towering rock and ice blocks. The route will then be marked using fixed ropes so we can carry equipment and food further up the mountain to the base of the second icefall and ultimately to the base of the southwest ridge. I hope that C1 will be established tomorrow and in preparation for this Dave Orange and Chris Barnes are joining Andy and Greg this afternoon to help them secure the route. The rest of the team are carrying more loads to the temporary camp.

The fine weather enjoyed on the trek has changed since our arrival and a pattern of fine, sunny mornings to about 11 am followed by wind and light snow showers in the afternoons and evenings seems to be the norm. Temperatures during the day vary between O degrees C and 28 degrees C and at night fall to -10 degrees C.

From C1 traversed by ski to base of arrete, dump made there and camp called C1.8 established on shelf by Rheinberger and Bruce at 22,250 ft with fixed rope to it - tent at C1.8, too dangerous for permanent camp. True C2 (slightly lower than C1.8) in a crevasse. Until now early Sept unsettled weather with frequent snowfall. Night that C2 was established severe avalanche down arrete went over C2 (taking a bit of equipment) and C1.8 completely taken away. Huge slab avalanche buried 2 members in snow cave of C3 but were dug out. This caused complete change of plans because of avalanche danger from constant avalanche activity. 

Abandoned route and went for N Face left of Great C Couloir. To 20 Sept made new C2 high in North Cwm at 22,500 ft and C3 at 23,750 ft on N Face occupied about 22 Sept by Farmer, Bruce, Andrews and Van Noorden. Weather again bad and Andrews developing edema, set off an avalanche in descent while Bruce infected liver. Andrews severe frostbite and evacuated to NZ. Had now lost 5 tents and 5 sleeping bags and 2 members at this time and Allen bad tooth. Doctor busy. 2 more decided to leave, Brooks bad stomach = 7 left, and then 2 more left, so by Oct 6 only 5 willing and able to have another go and yaks due Oct 12.
 
On 6 Oct climbed face left of previous route to 24,000 ft where put 2 tents - bad weather meant 3 nights there in high winds. 9 Oct traversed left to N Ridge and down to N Col where met Japanese N Col route. Descended from Col into East Rongbuk Glacier to Japanese C3 where spent night of 9 Oct. On 10th on down to BC. Reinberger, Farmer, Norman, Anderson and Van Noorden were these remaining 5 climbers.

1986 US Everest North Face Expedition 
(received Aug 1986 from Al Read who received this from leader)

The 1986 US Everest North Face expedition reached 25,500 ft in its attempt to make the second ascent of the Great Couloir of the North Face of Mt Everest. Bad weather, avalanche danger and exhaustion delayed and then ended the team's attempt to place the last camp (C6) and a try for the summit after its time expired.

The eleven member team reached Lhasa by air on March 9 and BC at the foot of the Rongbuk Glacier by jeep and truck on March 19. C1 was established a week later and C2 (20,000) and C3 (20,500) on the main Rongbuk Glacier north of the North Face by late March.

The route from the foot of the face to C4 (23,500 ft) was obstructed by a bergschrund at the start and made more difficult by 2000 ft of blue ice. Spring conditions differed considerably from the Styrofoam-like snow in the fall of 1984 when the Australian team made the first direct ascent of the couloir. The team spent a month placing 18 fixed ropes before occupying C4 on April 19 and another three weeks putting up C5. After 5 attempts to establish the last camp, the time expired and the team turned back, reaching BC on May 24 and Lhasa two days later.

Apart from one climber who suffered frostbitten fingers and had to return, a case of snowblindness, and much respiratory sickness early in March and early April, the members of the expedition were generally healthy.

The expedition members were Todd Bibler, Carlos Buhler, Dana Coffield, Mark Jenkins, Doug Kelley, Andy Lapkass, Michael Lehner, Joe Murphy, Sandy Stewart, Ann Whitehouse and Brinton Young.","1 frostbite, 1 snowblindness",,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2452316,

The three-man team attempted 2 routes from the south side, climbing without Sherpas, oxygen or fixed camps. First they tried to climb the West Ridge and spent the latter half of April attempting to get onto the Lho La, which they finally reached via snowfields near the Khumbutse ridge on 27th April. Next day they moved up Everest's West Ridge and bivouacked at 7100m, 100m down on the SW Face, which they descended into the Western Cwm and back to BC on the 30th. Next day turned their attention on the normal route via Lhotse's West Face; strong wind and snowfall delayed their progress but on 11th May two Polish members began to push from BC which resulted in their gaining a high point for Everest's summit of 7800m.

On the 14th May the 2 Poles, Lwow and Karolczak, went surreptitiously to the summit of Lhotse and back to their bivouac. They considered their Lhotse ascent good acclimatization for another go at the West Ridge route, but Karolczak now developed stomach illness and Austrian member Putz had dropped out of the climb because of an old back injury. 

On 24th May Lwow went alone up through the Khumbu Icefall to try to solo the normal route, but the following several days brought heavy snowfall, he was able to get no higher than 6700m; he was very tired and it would have taken him more days to reach the summit alone than were left in the climbing season; he returned to BC on 27th and abandoned the struggle on the 28th of May.

Japanese agreed expedition could follow Japanese route after 1 May so first tried to climb to Lho La and 3 times were on rocks via Yugoslav route with 3rd time on 17 April got to 50m below Lho La where couloir blocked final climb without 200m more fixed rope which Poles didn't have. 23 April went to left of Yugoslavia route up snow fields near Khumbutse ridge and 27 April bivouac at Canadians camp on Lho La at 6000m. 28 April biv 6900m on ridge and 29 April reached shoulder and bivouacked 100m down on face at 7100m. 30 April descended iced SW Face to W Cwm to Japan C2 and down to BC through Icefall. 1-3 May rest at BC. 4 May 3 members BC to biv at C2 in Cwm about 6700m. 5 May biv on Lhotse face at 7300m then bad weather (wind and snow) and C3 to BC on 7 May. 11 May 2 Poles BC to C2, 12th to C3, 13th to biv 7800m on Geneva Spur. On 14 May actually both Poles went to Lhotse summit and back to biv but officially stayed 14th in biv. Thought Lhotse climb = good acclimatization for W Ridge. Returned to BC 17th and then leader got stomach problem. 24th Lwow alone up through Icefall which was ""difficult"" and slept at 6700m. Now heavy snowfall and 2 more nights at same biv. 27 May down to BC through much changed Icefall where however he had placed marker flags. 28th 15 cm more new snow at BC and ""it was finished"" because Lwow very tired and would take 4 days to go to summit but only 3 days of season remained.

Did acclimatization climb to 1m below Lhotse summit rather than up Everest SE Ridge because couloir on Lhotse gave protection from wind.

Chilean was killed by avalanche which he precipitated by falling through cornice at North Col.

Were on traditional British/Chinese route via North Col.
5-6 members plus 5-6 Sherpas.

Later in 1986, a team of young mountaineers from the Catholic Univ began the second Chile attempt on Everest. Above the North Col at 7000m and at the precise moment when the depot for the attack camp was being prepared, loosened piece of the cornice struck Victor-Hugo Trujillo and he fell nearly 700 vertical meters.

3 went together from ABC to 7800m, where made snow cave and in couloir Beghin too sleepy and return to cave while they other 2 went to top. Met again at cave. Same day as they returned, Beghin started in evening alone but at 8300m at 11 pm in Hornbein again sleepy and returned to cave (which was empty) and slept there and next morning to ABC at 5800m just below Changtse ridge on Main Rangbuk Glacier.

No Sherpas, oxygen, no ropes at all, no sleeping bags on summit push. No accidents. No idea why Beghin so sleepy except were climbing at night to avoid avalanching.

This very light alpine-style makes possible more difficult routes and longer traverses can be done on 8000ers.

2 more attempts to regain Col on 20th and 22nd Oct but conditions of slab avalanche had worsened and Col primed for massive slab avalanche and not regained.

Oxygen used for sleeping at C4 on theory they would continue up to next day - only use of oxygen was by 4 men night of about 2 Oct.

No accidents except one fatal avalanche. No serious illness or frostbite.

Newsletter, Mt. Everest BC

From Lhasa it was a two-day bus ridge (via Gyantse and Shigatse) to Xegar, the romantic Shekar Dzong of early Everest literature. Here we stayed three nights and were able to climb the Dzong.
 
From Xegar an interesting day's truck ride over the Pang La, rising gradually into the mountains brought us at last to Everest. There is a difficult river crossing at the entrance to the Rongbuk  Valley, then a steep rough ride up to the Monastery (where again restoration is in progress) and beyond to our BC on the moraine of the Rongbuk Glacier.

With four Sherpas, David Swanson led our first train of yaks up the East Rongbuk Glacier to ABC at 21,300 ft on Aug 28. He wanted to see the mountain at close quarters before having to return on Sept2. Frantic sorting of equipment and high altitude rations occupied the next few days days and today a second yak train went up with Mike Weis and Mike Yeager, to be followed by another in a couple of days time.

The C3 has now been set at 23,200 ft. Everyone seems to be acclimatizing well. We have been suprised, and somewhat dismayed by the heavy volume of snow on the mountain. We are hoping season winds will help to remove some of it.


BC - Sept 15, 1986

We have now been established in BC for two and a half weeks. The monsoon is not yet over and the weather is harsh, but that hasn't prevented us from setting up and stocking our approach camps.

By Sept 4 we had 40 yaks loads delivered to our ABC at 21,000 ft and on Sept 5th five members reached the North Col, which will be the sight of our next camp. The route up to the Col was reconnoitered in chest deep snow by Mike Weis, David Breashears and Nima Temba, following the line of an enormous avalanche which had carried and killed one of the young Chileans, tearing through their line of fixed ropes.

On the following all members began drifting back to BC for a puja ceremony of blessing, which the Sherpas had arranged for Sunday 7, as being an auspicious day in their calendar.
 
During this period in BC, our first group of trekkers arrived under the leadership of Jed Williamson. The more energetic among them were able to visit our advanced camps in the next few days, while Jed himself agreed to stay on as a full member of the expedition.


Oct 1, 1986

More than a week of fine weather has greatly improved our fortunes and our spirits. Our way to the North Col is now re-established, after a five day storm, and we are able to make regular trips up there ferrying loads and getting a substantial camp organized. We need to be as strong as we can on the Col as this is the camp from which our film teams will operate.

We have also had good luck recently breaking trail above the North Col. Camp 4 at the sight of the early British Everesters C5, has been established and stocked at 25,600 ft. Efforts have been made to locate C5, at accomodate the first summit teams, and thereafter the search teams looking for artifacts from the 1924 British expedition. The camp is located high under the Northeast Ridge.

To ensure that climbers remain fit and frest for the hardwork that lies ahead high on the mountain, they are being rotated back to BC for short rest periods. The coughs and colds that plagued the members in the early weeks of the expedition are almost a thing of the past.
 
The team has been further strengthened by the arrival of Dave Cheesemond, straight from the American expedition K2. Almost immediately after his arrival in BC, Dave headed for Advanced Base, where he will assist David Breashears and Mike Weis with film duties.

On Sept 19 George Bell and Donna de Varona arrived in BC. Donna is the on-camera host of the hour long ABC Sports special we are shooting about the first American woman to go to the summit of Everest (keep your fingers crossed). George will produce and write it. It was a pleasure to see Donna out shooting within hours of her arrival, paying scant regard to her sudden elevation in altitude. Donna even made the trip to Yak Camp at 19,000 ft with hopes of getting to Advanced Base, before being turned back by a snowstorm.  George also got footage for NBC News. Today Show and worked on sequences for the historical documentary with David Breashears and Andy Harvard. George and Donna left BC on Oct 1st.
 
BC remains a place of unexpected sociability. John Roskelley was here with a group of trekkers that included several old friends. They were bound for the Lho La, the pass that looks into Nepal.
 
The good weather has also enabled our neighbours, the British Northeast Ridge Expedition, once more to make progress on their route. The ""Air Over Everest"" group across the parking lot have attempted two test flights with their first saw speed skier Steve McKinney launch into uncertain wind condition, culminating in a spectacular and uncomfortable landing. It was, Steve told us, what is known in the trade as ""beaking"" - when the nose of the glider and pilot impact the ground somewhat forcefully. Lucky for Steve, his customized helmet allowed him to get away with superficial bruises and cuts.

 
1986 Mt Everest - 26  Nov

October in the Himalaya was marked by unremitting high winds and heavy snows. Almost daily storm clouds moved up the valley, dropping few inches of snow on our base camp at 17,000 ft and dumping much heavier falls high up. Sue Giller remembers reading four books in five days, while occasionally peering out her tent flap at Advanced BC only to see her chances of making the summit buried in an apparently endless snowfall. This was a typical feeling for most of the team members who were on the mountain in the first half of the month.

The frustration was compounded by the fact that virtually all members of the expedition had made great progress in early Oct. After nearly two months in BC, and a week long hike, Audrey Salked reached ABC.  All three of the women climbers - Sue Giller, Mary Kay Brewster, and Catherine Cullinane, were well acclimatized and ready for a push to the upper slopes. Indeed, Mary Kay and Catherine set personal altitude records by reaching 24,500 ft one morning under a bright sky of fast moving clouds. Accompanied by three Sherpas, David Breashears had established C5 on Oct 4.
 
On Oct 12, the Air-Over Everest group decided to leave the mountain. Led by Heidi Benson, the team was ultimately frustrated by heavy snows on their route.

On Oct 16, the British team - our neighbours in BC for two and a half months - determined that they had had enough of the weather and began to retreat from Everest. We remembered Joe Brown's cramped birthday party in the British BC, and the friendship we had made with the British climbers, and we were sorry to see them go. Clearly and early winter had arrived in our part of Tibet.

On the next day, one of our best loved Sehrpas, Dawa Nuru, 32, was killed in a small slab avalanche at 22,000 ft while descending from the North Col camp. David Breashears pulled him from the debris of snow and ice. Two days later, Danudu, as he was known to all, received a proper Buddhist burial, with cremation and prayer performed at the Rongbuk Nunnery. His death surprised and deeply saddened all the members of the team, and put us on alert to the danger of avalanche in the col.

In the days that followed Danudu's cremation, attempts were made to hike above Advanced BC to reassess the avalanche danger. The prognosis was not good. On Oct 23, leader Andrew Harvard, made the decision to call off the expedition.

The team spent nearly a week getting of the mountain and packing up gear in the BC. The sadness over Danudu's death and the frustration of the expedition were inescapable, still there was a sense that no other team could have done any better under a similar conditions. Everyone performed well, and a few climbers went higher than they had ever gone before. When it was time for the trucks and jeeps to leave BC, we reluctantly split up: half the team headed for Lhasa, the other half for KTM.

On Nov 2, Andy Harvard carried the first Earth Run torch through the streets of Lhasa.

On the same day in KTM, David Breashears consoled the brothers of Danudu and offered the assistance of the expedition in helping Danudu's wife and three young sons.

Despite Danudu's death and the weather which prevented any of the women from trying for the summit, moreover, leaving us unable to conduct a thorough search for Mallory and Irvine at the 28,000 ft terrace, there was a positive feeling about the expedition. It came out of the heartfelt conviction that we had done everything that we could on the mountain.

We knew there were risks. Danudu knew there were risks. Still, we went and he went with us. I think everyone of us would go again. And almost immediately, there was talk of going back. It was this enthusiasm for the experience that most of us will remember.

               Raymond Monnerat, 44, followed by Peter Weber, 44, an 
               architect, both from Switzerland, the third was Dr. Simon
               Burkhardt. At this time a big powder avalanche from the 
               Lhotse couloir overspoiled Peter and Raymond. They
               survived this avalance and continued the way to the C3.
          1115 Raymond and Peter reached C3 by running for their life.
          1130 Simon was at that time at the Yellow Band and crossed the
               last few meters under the Lhotse wall to C3. A first powder
               avalanche covered him, but he could go on.
          1145 avalanche killed him. He was hanging in the fixed rope.
               His neck was hit by a ice piece.

Summit attempt by 3 members on 14 Oct by Pete Athans, Catherine Freer and Andy Politz; got to 22,500 ft in 24 hours and back because of bad snow conditions and weather deteriorating. Were trying Japanese Couloir to Hornbein Couloir.


Pete Athans - 24 Oct 86

He left BC 19 Oct. Had been big effort to get gliders up to take offs. One went fine just 1000 ft above Lho La; camp had been 200-300 ft below Lho Lha; had ropes to C3 on shoulder at about 23,750 ft.

Gliders then hauled to C3 by 10 Oct. Then high winds for a week but mile-long snow plume engulfing North Ridge.

Tried to climb at night up Hornbein got to 7000m at 1:30 am but water ice and wind slab. Athans, Freer and Politz on 14/15 Oct and returned to Lho La and C1.


Hang-gliders

McKinney hang-glided; winds later made flights impossible. 3-person alpine-style attempt up Japanese couloir by Athans, Freer and Politz to 23,000 ft - too cold about 15 Oct. 

All Ok. Left BC 26 Oct highest camp was at 23,800 ft for gliding and highest point reached was 24,000 ft 12 Oct for landing glider.

Put in a camp at 25,500 ft but was occupied only one night probably, defeated by winds and avalanching. Enormous amount of equipment abandoned on North Col, too dangerous to retrieve.

One Sherpa death
Leave BC 28 Oct
Winds on Col terrible.

Athans had to leave for trek the leads in Nepal. More gliding planned but more high climbing seemed ruled out.

Peter Athans, American team (McKinney) - 24 Jan 2009

Many of us went to the high point, the West Shoulder, then. Perhaps the entire team. The objective was to have a hang-glider launch from there and fly over the top. Certainly myself, Kim Carpenter, Andy Politz, Catherine Freer went up to that point.

No Sherpas from our team were killed. There was a British team that lost a young Sherpa from Phortse village and I believe his name was Ang Phu or Phu Tashi. I don't remember specifically.

On 18th May, Roger moved up from lake camp 18,300 ft and to follow on 19th. Roger to leave 2:00 am 20th, he rested at 19,500 ft on 19th. Ruth on 19th started out and Pasang too for short distance - route passed than US BC half way. Just outside lake camp, Ruth saw Roger at 23,500 ft in Japanese Couloir climbing strong, steadily at 10:00 am.

Plan was for Roger on 1st day to reach bottom of Hornbein at 26,000 ft at 4 pm and biv there; instead of this, he quit at 1:30 pm in rocks at c24,500 ft. From that point on Ruth worried. Plan was that 2nd day he'd get up at midnight, start climb at 2:00 am and summit 12:00. 1:00 pm down to tent at bottom of Hornbein but on 20th no sign of 11:00 am when just at top of Japanese Couloir at most at 25,000 ft. At 25,500 ft at 1:30 pm he sat down and didn't get up for very long time. Others saw him pitch tent at 25,500-25,800ft. 19th Ruth to 19,500 ft and slept there alone. 20th 3:00 pm Ruth down to US camp knowing Roger in trouble. 21st at 1st light saw tent Roger at same spot at 25,500 ft. 6:00 am she left for lake camp and saw Roger moving, coming down. For 1-1/2 hours couldn't see him but 8:30 am saw him came out of rocks into snow. Ruth headed back up to 19,500 ft to where Roger would arrive. 9:30 am passed US camp and all agreed he was coming down strong. At 11:10 am Ruth arrived at ABC and looks with binoculars and sees Roger's body at 20,500 ft. Ruth tears up telling herself it was a rock and Roger just behind the next rise - trail flagged with bamboo poles - hoped he at US C1. She had to climb steep snow came at top of which was Roger and saw he was badly smashed up. She did not go nearer but turned down to US camp and then on to her own camp to which Pasang would arrive next day. Roger had cerebral edema Ruth believes Pasang and 2 Sherpas from US expedition went up to Roger, straightened him up (neck, arm, etc broken) and put him into at bottom of Japanese Couloir. Sherpas took out Roger's camera and photographed his body before putting him in. 

When Ruth was near him she saw trail of Roger's fall just before he would start down climbing below ice - fell 500-1000 ft. Must have had edema to have made mistake: Roger very cautious and expert. Roger decides on 17th May to start up earlier than planned start of 25th May. He was impatient and by incredible pressure to get climb over with, with obsession to do climb. Think Roger stayed 2nd night where he did because couldn't go down and hoped to solve problem by going up - pack when found no food, gear, only camera and clothing; had ice tools and ski pole with him.

Before push Roger had climbed 6800m peak near BC and was 3rd trip to ABC on summit push.

Roger had originally thought to climb at night and rest in day as Loretan and Troillet in 1986 but this May there wasn't the snow as last August and difficulty of climb without snow (with only base rock and blue ice only) made him change plan and climb in daylight.


Simonson, US Everest - 1 June 87

Roger Marshall didn't know what he was doing. He was surprised at lack of snow, which is normal in spring, had parachute along for his descent but had never used one before (did not actually take it with him on ascent) had no other coherent plan for his descent (said maybe would come down US route but didn't ask permission), had ice tools in his pack when he fell 100 ft down ice using only ski poles at that point.

By all routes it was wind that drove would be summiters back. In addition climbers in C6 were exhausted from long time at high altitude without O2 and no Sherpa support. Only one Sherpa went as far as C2 while others went home early; in last week of May, members started leaving BC to go to KTM with only 4 left on 30 May, because of transport problem.

High point at top of yellow band and onto snowfield.

Route attempted was same as that of Reinhold Messner in 1980 via the North Col, North Face and Great Couloir. But the Swedes failure to get much above the yellow band was due, according to a member, Hans Lagerhorn, to three mistakes: (1) ABC should have been placed on a site better protected from the winds, which blew it away in mid-May; (2) C6 should not have been pitched at only 8000m, but at 8150m, where team had originally planned to put it, but the first summit-attack team did not have the strength to get it so high -- they should not have done all the lead climbing, but one of their members, Lars Cronlund, did reach the expedition's highest point; and (3) the second summit team had enough manpower and time to move the camp higher but failed to do so.

Made rapid progress to N Col. Then C5 only in mid-May because of winds and very cold. ABC completely blown away in 1st half May and had to retreat. 1st summit attempt on 21st; had traversed from C5 to Great Couloir as per Messner route to C6. On 21st reached 8650m by Gronland who started up with Americans and he turned back because oxygen ran out; had done lead climbing on rock band and turned up his flow of oxygen; back to C6 and next day down to N Col and lower. 

2nd and last summit bid by Malmsten and Tenzing Sherpa, who started from C6 on 23 May, day after 30cm new snow and windy: at 2am left camp and in knee-deep loose snow gained 300 vertical meters in 9 hrs, so at 11 am stopped and rested long time. Knew before they started up it was known theirs would be last attempt because would take another week to get more oxygen and other supplies up. Yaks and trucks are arriving at BC. In descent moved very slowly, trying to take down too much gear. 

1 member spent entire night pacing back and forth till collapsed in morning and lay under rock; very luckily Sirdar Nawang saw him collapse and he could be found and brought down with no frostbite at all. Tenzing had made biv and got frostbitten fingers which will heal.

Degerfel used special wing-type parachute from N Col to almost ABC on 22 May. Expedition failed to reach summit because of 3 mistakes:

1. ABC should have been placed in better protected site.
2. C4 should have been placed at 8150m as planned but did not have strength.
   1st team should not have done all lead climbing. 
3. 2nd summit team had manpower and time to move it up but did not do so.
   Higher C6 could have meant summit success.

Only 2 days of really good weather with negligible wind and clear skies.

Two Sherpas got mild frostbite and then stayed at BC. Only 4 Sherpas available for high climbing because of this and illness.

Made normal steady progress to N Col. David was with 1st team to Col late March using Chilean fixed ropes all way to Col.

All then descended, leaving some members at ABC and rest to BC puja on auspicious day, 2 or 3 April.

Early April high winds 4-5 days. At ABC destroyed 2-3 several tents and both tents at Col. ABC collapsed and all from Col and ABC down.

C3 - 6000-6000m - used by yak herder and members
ABC - 6300-6400m
C4 - 7000m, 10m below Col on leeward side

On 24 April tried to go to C5 and got to 7300-7400m and then turned back by high winds and col. Are going over to Great Col at about 7900m.

Plan: 
C6 at 8000-8100m
C5 at 7600-7700m

Member's early departure from Everest expedition spring 1987:
  Baumeister (expedition's doctor) left about 25 March; thought he had 
    pneumonia and did not go above low BC.
  Allison left 2 April; got to ABC and then developed altitude problems.
  Breashears left 28 April after having finished his photography.
  East as arranged in advance, arrived late (5 April) and left early (12 May) 
    because of business; got to C2.
  Van Hoy left 27 May to arrange bus transport and have airline bookings confirmed.
  Nobori left 28 May with Simonson, tired.

C1 only on 6th Sept because Hanns Schell didn't have his Sherpas make route early (disorganized there). Then snow until 12 Sept and then after that perfect weather until terrible winds of end month and winds never stopped. Michel Dacher made weird route in cwm which was more dangerous than icefall (was right beneath W Shoulder and thence through high crevasse and back under W Shoulder). Then Hillary's team went up Lhotse Face for acclimatization and fixed rope in process. Then down to BC and summit push: Kim and Michael on 25th Sept and Peter and John on 26th from BC. Kim and Michael had bad time making C3 space (were too close to pillar's rock) on 26th and bad night with clouds building up and wind starting - should have turned back but carried on and 27th were up higher in very strong tent which was battered by strong winds. They managed to survive (cut hole in floor to get snow to melt) and descended terribly slowly via col, unrelated to reality (talked of going back up in 2 days) and extremely dehydrated - ""extremely lucky men"" to have survived. Peter and John very angry at their stupidity at not having turned back in 26th. Before seeing Kim and Michael depart from BC (Michael returned to BC later but did no more climbing), Peter and John went up to cwm 30th Sept and stayed there a week then down and up and down rest of time because saw no point: high winds, clouds and falling barometer showed useless, left cwm 30th Oct for last time. 

Left BC 1 Nov while going through icefall huge area of it (10 acres) moved like waves; high crevasse opened up; by now no one keeping icefall open. Peter reached 24,500 ft (about 7500m) on Lhotse Face.


Mullar - 8 Nov 87

Peter and John spent much time in C2 and some to C3 on Europeans. Peter and John never seriously tried pillar because in bad weather and no oxggen can get into very bad condition.

Decided finally to quit 30th from C2 (said on walkie-talkie). Must have reached BC safely since no report to the contrary from Sherpas with Snowbird team who stayed later.


Schell - 19 Oct 87

Peter in evening 13th down to BC after 8 days in C2. Planned to go up again via Lhotse Face, but waiting for wind change first; will wait for sometime.


British women runner - 12 Oct 87

British were at Everest BC night of 6/7 Oct. Peter and Muir left BC at 8:00-9:00 pm to go to C2, spend a day resting at C2 and then push for top if weather good. Not sure whether Mike went up with them or not, probably not.


Logan - 9 Oct 87

C3 26 Sept Pillar 24,800 ft by Kim and Mike. Had acclimatization on Lhotse Face.
C4 26,500 ft on SE Ridge on 27th with C3's tent. Storm came 5:00 pm very fast. Wind unstable (wind took slab on Lhotse Shar). Stayed there that night and tent poles broke and wind and wind blown snow through fabric - start of frostbite.

28th down to Col and to C2 biv rope Sherpas ahd fixed on 26th. No fixed rope on pillar, so descent has to be via Col. Others will stay 2 more weeks on mountain. Logan left BC 1 Oct.

Mike Reinberger has slightly frostbitten fingers and will have serious frostbite if he returned to mountain as he is determined to do, preferably up Lhotse Face to Col. Peter and John well and going again to Pillar.


Two New Zealanders and two Australians attempted without Sherpas or bottled oxygen to repeat the American autumn 1981 route up the South Pillar to the SE Ridge, but terrible winds, perhaps as strong as 200 mph, defeated them. Logan and Rheinberger had considerable difficulty on 26th Sept making camp C3 at 7560m because they were too close to the rock of the pillar, and they had a bad night that night when clouds built up and the winds began to blow. In Hillary's view the pair should have gone down from C3 but instead on 27th they moved on up to make camp C4 at 8080m, the team's highest point reached. Their strong tent was severely battered by the wind, and they had to cut a hole in its floor to obtain snow to melt to drink, but they managed to survive. ""They were extremely lucky men!"" to have done so, Hillary said, and on 28th Sept they descended the mountain via the South Col. They were frostbitten and seriously dehydrated, and their climb was over, but Hillary and Muir continued to hope for a break in the weather; it never came, and they finally abandoned hope on 30th Oct.

Rested and down to BC for brief period than hoped. 19th blizzard started. On 19th 2 Nepalis in a tent at a half-way point above BC; on the 19th a blizzard began, and it created 3 avalanches which swept a tent and Mangal Singh Tamang buried by it; body found on 21st and cremated at Rongbuk monastery on 23rd. Yaks couldn't get to ABC and trucks couldn't get to BC, so 4 members ported loads for 4 days from ABC to BC yaks.

No oxygen, no Sherpas to Everest top with him.

Skis to South Col and if has luck with snow above Col will take skis to summit and down. First to Lhotse summit from face via Couloir then without return to BC picks up his skis left at Lhotse Face and to South Col where sleeps 1 night next day up Everest wtih skis on his back to ski down most of this distance too (if not all because of rock like Hillary Step).

Ski from Everest top to Cwm in same day, maybe 3 hours including rest at Col and again on Lhotse West Face. Will have come down via east side of Geneva Spur (but pillar and Spur). Max 45-degree slope.

Past ski descents: 55-60 degrees in Alps.
""Not problem about skiing, very good skier; but problem may be no breath on summit and not enough power to go down with skis from summit.

His skis 130 cm long, 7 cm wide (normal 180 cm for alpine skis in Europe). Shorter and lighter weight easier to carry, easier to swing; larger skis mean no control to slow and stop and go around rocks, etc. Hopes go only 20 km/hour. No practice skiing in Khumbu.

55% chance he will be able to ski from Everest summit; if only 50-50, stupid to try, but 51-49 average not stupid. He is quiet and undramatic.

Brooks & Rheinberger - 5 June 1988

No attempt made to climb West Ridge, for which had permission. Rheinberger: ""we kept it as an option till we saw how much 3-nation expedition would tolerate us.""

Towards end of climbing period when 3-nation team was with leaving from Everest, several Australian members urged them to take on some Sherpas to send up load-carrying and save members strength - matter was debated and decision went against the idea.


18 May 1988

Australians 2-3 May reached Col - after that leader and some members went at Lobuje 26-27 and others 2-3 May.

Upper slopes of ""Neverest Buttress"" actually quite safe but lower part close to avalanche danger. Other part of face huge serac bands that fell off and powder snow avalanches. Took 21 days to get to BC with snow too deep for yaks and daily heavy snowfall. Had to get porters to get transport loads. They went to ABC, climbed buttress to 40 ft wide and 100 ft deep glacier which took difficult technical climbing to overcome. Fixed 4000 ft of rope from bottom of buttress to where it eases off at about 22,000 ft or so. Again weather turned bad. Made one carry of loads to 24,500 ft on 1 May and then to ABC while snowed. 

Arrived for summit bid 5th May but weather of 2-3 May snow brought big avalanches; so summit push by all 4 members on 8th May from ABC. 9th knee-deep snow from C1 to C2 took 14 hrs. 10th May 11-hour haul from C2, which they picked up and carried to South Col, where pitched tent (did not see Japanese-Chinese-Nepal tents in their hurry to pitch it and get out of wind). 11th 3 stayed at Col because of wind while Teare developing altitude sickness so down to ABC (in 7 hours). Eve of 11th winds abated so 3 set out from Col at 11:00 pm. Venables to top 3:40 pm 12th; other 2 were behind him and turned back at or very near S Summit in deteriorating weather. Webster and Anderson slept that night in Japanese tent at C5 of Japan-China-Nepal expedition while Venables spent night at 8500m on slope below S Summit because couldn't find way down in misty weather. Venables caught up with others at Japanese tent and all there to S Col together where stayed remainder of 13th resting and slept there that night, which shouldn't have done because of altitude. Very slow descent. 14th to C1 in afternoon. 15th tried to go down in afternoon but snowed and had to return to C2. 16th managed to get started at 11:00 am and to ABC at 4:00 pm (Webster and Venables) while Anderson couldn't find route and spent night out at 22,500 ft and down to ABC about 8:00 pm on 18th with the help from bottom of buttress by photographer.

Accidents and Injuries:
  Anderson's frostbite one big toe and same fingers which probably will heal.
  Venables 5 toes which could lose tips of (nose frostbitten but is healing).
  Webster's 5 toes and 5 fingers; will probably loose 1st digits of fingers.

When Venables set off from South Col, he knew toes were getting numb and took conscious decision to go on up anyway.

A safe line was used up the center of the serac field. C4 was set up on the col on Sept 21 and a few days later a group reached C5 at 25,000 ft. Winds destroyed tents at C4 and C5 and, after several more tries, the expedition was called off on Oct 14. The team returned to Base Camp after 57 days on the mountain.

I think, but I am not sure, that Susan Havens is one. If so, she is AAC. They apparently have sold theirs to the television cameras.

Mrs. Okawara - 21 Feb 1988

Mrs. Okawara has heard that her friend Mr. Hasegawa has been leading a small expedition to N Side of Everest this winter and is still there, but she has no details. She believes some Sherpas are with the Japanese but doesn't know where. She does not expect members to come to KTM.

US Everest North, Winter 1987

Japanese unclimbed North Ridge arrived BC 16 Oct and start climb 1 Nov
20 Japanese and 15-16 Sherpas.

(From The American Alpine Journal 1989, pg 271, by Tsuneo Hasegawa)

Our expedition consisted of :
1. Masayoshi Utsumi
2. Kiyotaka Hoshino
3. Mrs. Masami Hasegawa (leader's wife)
4. Tsuneo Hasegawa, leader

As reported in AAJ 1988 on 273, we were prevented from getting to the mountain earlier by the big snowstorm in Oct. We were given permission to continue during the winter.

The route we attempted was a new one, which began east of the North Col. We climbed the northeast shoulder at about 7800m.

We established ABC-C2 at 6450m on Nov 24, 1987. From there we climbed to 7000, 7200, 7450m and 7500m on Dec 11, 19, 24 and 27, respectively. We established C3 at 7350m on Jan 20 and occupied in on Feb 7. On Feb 9, we climbed to 7700m.

We removed ABC on Feb 23 and BC on the 26th. During the mountaineering activity, the wind blew steadily from 150 to 200 kph. The tent at C3 was damaged by the falling rock and ice many times, since there was no safe tent site in the couloir.",,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453103,

Another Japanese team led by Tsuneo Hasegawa (40) comprised 5 members approached Qomolangma in Oct-Dec from northeast side.

Started into icefall 5th April but very hard ice took long time to make way through it.

Larry Neilson, Gerry Roach, Peter Jamieson, Dave Breashears and Sherpa reached the summit on May 7. Nielson and Ang Rita climbed without supplemental oxygen, Nielson being the first American to accomplish such feat.

On May 14th the team of Gary Neptune, Jim States and Sherpa Lhakpa Dorje reached the summit. Climbing leader Phil Ershler and Ang Phurba Sherpa attempted summit climb on the same day without oxygen but were forced to turn back due to imminent risk of frostbite.

On May 17, the team of Dick Bass, Ed Hixson, Yogendra Thapa and Sherpas Norbu Jangbu, Lhakpa Tshering and Ang Dale set out from the South Col but were forced to turn around late in the morning at 28,000 ft level owing to deep soft snows which prevented further progress at that altitude.

On May 21 the fourth team of Frank Wells and Sherpas Ang Rita and Phortse Gyalzen reached the South Col at 26,200 ft. Two hours after reaching the col a severe wind storm started with winds placed at 50 mph gusting up to [?] mph. The three attempted to wait out the storm for 3 nights and the storm for 3 nights and 4 days at the col but with no sign of [relief and] food supplies running low the three were forced back to C2 on fourth day.

Bass, Thapa and two Sherpas launched their second attempt on May 24. They fought through the continuing windstorm and reached C4 at the South Col late on 24th only to be pinned down in their tents for two further days before finally being forced to retreat.

Wells then attempted to organize a further assault only to find there was insufficient oxygen left for any further.

Climbing activities on the mountain were then officially terminated by climbing leader Ershler with all climbers and Sherpas returning safely through the rapidly deteriorating icefall to base camp.

Bass and Wells, the organizers of the seven summits Everest expedition, commented upon their return to base Camp:

""We are both personnaly disappointed that we did not reach the summit - particularly when each of us feels somewhat to our own surprise - given the way we reacted to high altitude. We could have reached the summit had the weather and deep snows not prevented us from going further. At the same time we are deeply [gratified] that everyone has returned safely that the expedition placed and 8 climbers on top including the first American without oxygen (covered in an amazing technological achievement by microwave transmission) and frankly that we each reached the legendary 8000m level or higher there only 14 mountains in the world which reach 8000 meters.

After trying Everest from Tibet last year and Nepal this year, will they try again? Bass suggestive. 


Roach and Jamieson:

Expedition over, ended today all coming down or one down
Bass, Thapa 2nd attempt for summit on Wed; reached 28,000 ft and turned back because bad weather. 
Wells at BC 17,700 ft. 
Bass and Thapa C2 to BC today probably with Neptune and Marts.
Doubt Wells got above C4. Expedition probably leaving BC tomorrow. 

No indication anyone not used too bad. Dick is fundamentally strong enough to climb Everest in right situation, but that situation did not present itself, i.e., good weather, good oxygen, good logistics.

Jamieson: ""I'm sorry they didn't make it cause they spent great deal of time and effort and many in hopes of reaching summit, which was a goal that was very important to them and their seven summits endeavour. However their failure to reach the summit by no means detracts from the success of their Everest expedition.""

Total expedition extremely successful says Jamieson.


Nielson - 24 May 83

Bass going to C4 from C3. Wells down to C3 from C4. ""I would suspect it means that Frank's giving up."" Don't know who's with Bass and Wells. Ershler is in BC. They spent 3 days in C3 and he's not using oxygen and were wearing out.

Hixson yesterday much improved. 


ABC/HEV - 23 May 83

Wells and Bass still in C4 and C3 respectively because too much snow from yesterday; today fine. Hixson in hospital. Don't know what went wrong; extreme altitude sickness; came from BC yesterday by helicopter.

Ershler down to C2 today; ""looks like he's calling it quits.""


Nielson - 14 May 83

Phil has excellent judgement, so if he turned around there was a good reason. I personally hope that if he turned around I'd like to see him go again and maybe use oxygen there next time. I know he is dedicated to not using oxygen but hope he'll use it if necessary. He went to 26,000 ft on Everest North Face last without oxygen.

""The more people we get to the top the stronger is our expedition. We don't have people with big names on our expedition [experience], but we have a lot strong people.""

Lenser not planning summit bid; staying in BC.

Icefall glacier surging and moving now and breaking up since a week ago. Top part fallen in thrice. ""Longer you stay high, the more your body will deteriorate."" Ershler likely to have come down to C2.

""He's respected enough by the expedition that I'm sure they will want him in the 3rd or 4th group.

3rd attempt Monday or Tuesday. Leave enough time for 2nd party to return to C2 this clears C3 and C4. A C5 likely to be only a tent and oxygen for use on descent plus perhaps extra Sherpas carrying oxygen.

3 am would be dark but 4 am light enough not to need flashlights.


Ang Rita's use of oxygen - Spring 83:

Ang Rita actually did use bottled oxygen, according to American climber David Breashears, who went to the summit of Everest on the same day as Ang Rita, the 7th of May, on the American expedition led by Phil Ershler and Gerhard Lenser.

Breashears said in a letter to me dated 2 July, 1987, ""during my ascent of Everest in May of 1983, I shared a tent on the South Col which was our high camp with Ang Rita. At that time, he used oxygen for sleeping before and after our summit ascent. On the summit day, he was carrying a bottle of oxygen and a regulator, but deposited this in the snow several hundred feet above the Col. The entire summit day was spent by him without the use of supplemental oxygen.""
    
""Please keep in mind that I present these facts to you for the purpose of keeping the record straight. I don't believe that Ang Rita would deny the above (which he has done several times since 1987), or that it matters to him. I can't think of a stronger climbing companion or a Sherpa for whom I have more respect than Ang Rita, and he did climb Everest in 1984 with the Czech expedition without any use of oxygen whatsoever.""

On 17th October 1988, Breashears told me that Ang Rita definitely slept on oxygen at the South Col in 1983.

Notes by E. Hawley - Nov 2004

On 4th Nov, I met Nuru Jangbu Sherpa, a summiter on this expedition. He is 50 years old and speaks only basic English, but interpreting for him in the Sherpa language during much of the interview was Ang Rita Sherpa of the Himalayan Trust. Nuru Jangbu had some difficulty recalling details of the 1989 climb, but he appeared to be doing his best.

He said that base camp was at the normal site for teams climbing Everest from Nepal. They made C1 on the Lho La and climbed all the way to the summit via the West Ridge -- did not go over onto the North Face and into the Hornbein Couloir. Their other high camps, C2 and C3, were on the West Ridge.

It took Nuru Jangbu, Nima Rita Sherpa and the Korean (whose name he never mentioned) 11 or 12 hours to climb from C3 to the top. This last day's climb was ""very difficult,"" he said several times in English. ""Sometimes very steep, sometimes many rocks."" There was mixed rock and snow on the route; they fixed 300 meters of rope from C3 to the summit. Nima Rita was in the lead, then came the Korean and last was Nuru Jangbu. The two Sherpas were not using oxygen but the Korean was.

All three men definitely reached the summit. ""If Korean no going to summit, I no going to summit,"" he said firmly. They were there at 12:30 pm; the Korean took pictures of the two Sherpas and they took pictures of him. (Nuru Jangbu was unable to find his copy two years ago).

The descent was also very difficult because all of them were extremely tired. They worked their way down from the top in a sitting position because of their exhaustion. They returned to C3 at 6:00 pm.

Pertemba Sherpa was base camp sirdar for a Japanese team climbing Everest at the same time via the South Col-SE Ridge. He told me on 8th Nov that his team had to make three attempts to reach the summit because of a lot of snowstorms and finally three members and two of his strongest Sherpas succeeded only on the third try, on 13 October, after ""a long wait"" for better weather. (Also on the summit that day were the Mexican, Carlos Carsolio, also via the South Col, and a Korean up the South Pillar). When his team left base camp, the West Ridge team were still on the mountain. (The West Ridge climbers summited ten days after his team's men).

Nima Rita later told Pertemba back in KTM, ""We were successful,"" but ""it was very difficult and I nearly died,"" meaning he nearly collapsed. He did not specify who the others with him were nor did he gaive any details of the climb. Pertemba did not -- and does not -- doubt Nima Rita's claim of success.


Sange Sherpa (Interview with Liz Hawley) - 6 Feb 2004

I met the Korean autumn 1989 Everest sirdar, Sange Sherpa. He is 67 years old and not well, but he kindly took the trouble to come into the center of town to meet me. 

He said he never went above south-side base camp in 1989; from there he could see C1 and C2, but not higher ones since they were on ""the back [north] side"" of the mountain. I showed him a diagram of the North Face and asked whether the climbing route had been here, across the face into the Hornbein Couloir and up to the ridge, and he said no, they had stayed close to the ridge all the way -- they climbed ""ridge direct.""

He added that he had seen the Couloir (he did not give it a name) from Kala Patar and it is ""very difficult."" (He didn't know that it had ever been climbed.)

The team's climbing sirdar Nima Rita told him back in base camp that they had reached the summit. (He himself never reached any summits in a long career of working with expeditions because his father, a monk, told him he should not go where the gods live.)


Korean Everest Expedition, autumn 1989 - Notes by E.Hawley, 10 Jan 2004

Yesterday I met Mr. Lee, the leader of the Korean team on Everest in 1989. He acts like an old man although he is only 48, he seem to be ill, his English is only so-so and sometimes difficult to understand, and his conversation strays from the point, but his conviction that his summit team was successful came over very clearly. He does no climbing these days; he is a journalist and is representative in Nepal for the Korean Alpine Journal and The Man and Mountain Publishers in Seoul.

He said he had been asked by numerous people over the years about his team's success. He attributed the problem to a Korean climbed named Nam Sun-Woo, who had summited Everest in October 1988 via the South Pillar and who fully 18 months later raised questions aboute the veracity of summit claims by Lee's Everest expedition; he also questioned those of other Korean teams to Manaslu, Annapurna I and two other peaks. Lee pointed out -- quite rightly -- that some Koreans climbers are like this,"" discounting successes by compatriots; he cites the well known case of Um Hong-Gil vs. Park Young-Seok. I remember Nam as a pleasant fellow who imported a lot of extra boots -- perhaps other items -- with his expedition baggage to sell in Kathmandu.

Lee said when questions started coming after Nam expressed grave doubt because summiter Chung had no summit photo, ""I shut my lips"" and refused to discuss the subject. But being called a liar has been ""like a cancer inside my stomach"" all these years. He opened his lips only to speak to me because I am an old woman whom he respects, and he will not talk about the subject again (whether not to me again, was not clear). I asked him several times about the fact that the Korean Alpine Federation does not recognize Chung's ascent, but he never addressed the point.

Lee revised his description of the actual climbing route. He originally planned for the route to be the same as the American 1963 West Ridge route via the Hornbein Couloir, but when he came to Kathmandu he was told by Prachanda Man Shrestha (Ministry of Tourism mountaineering section) and the South Korean embassy (who had referred the matter to Seoul) that they must not cross the border into Tibet. At that time South Korea had no diplomatic relations with China, as China recognized its close friend North Korea as the only legitimate government of the Korean peninsula. So at the last minute their route was changed. He did not explain why he told me the wrong route when he returned to Kathmandu in 1989 and I did ask this awkward question, which would have been embarrassing for him and pointless anyway.

So they climbed entirely along the W Shoulder and W Ridge to the summit and back to the Lho La. Lee himself went no higher than C1 just below the pass, presumably not on its north side. The altitudes of C3 and C4 were the same as he had said in 1989 with C4 on a snowfield on the ridge. The Chilean team on the W Ridge from the north and Lee's people had their C4 tents as the same place and occupied them at the same time (but this doesn't jibe with the information that the Chilean leader gave me). Lee added that two Chilean tents were destroyed by the fierce winds and seemed to say the two teams shared Korean tents (but this may be wrong and I did not press the point). The two teams even shared the same walkie-talkie wavelength.

Lee seemed to explain his incorrect information to me in 1989 about his team's actual route by saying that he had returned to Kathmandu early and spoken to me before his team members and sirdar (Sange Sherpa) came back; his was ill with a stomach problem at the time.

Chung did not have a summit photo because his camera had rolled down the North Face. But Lee is certain that Chung, Nima Rita and Nuru Jangbu were successful since Nima Rita (now dead, as Lee pointed out) had been to the top in October 1988 and was positive that they had been to the summit this time. ""I am sure our team had complete success.... We were a big expedition -- this was not a small team or a solo climb -- so how can it not be true? Many other teams there too.""


Eberhard Jurgalski - 2002

Chung's success later doubted by Korean Alpine Federation since he could not provide them with an adequate description of the upper part of the West Ridge route. His name was removed from their list of Everest summiters.

C1 at below Lho La on its north side
C2 at just below West Shoulder on north side

C1 to C2 very difficult. Deposited two O2 bottles & made platform at 8400m for bivouac on return. Weather now in 20th Oct & strong wind like winter & with no one else now on mountain so had halfway decided to abandon climb, but carried on. Had to descend same route as that of ascent since S Col team had left & taken away icefall ladders. Summit trio left C4 1-2 am, reached summit 12:30 pm by Sherpas first & Chung slightly later on full O2 flow. In descent slept at 8400m. 24th descended to C3, 25th to C1 & 26th to BC. No chance for second summit attack because food supplies dwindling, members tired & winter weather setting in. High on mountain snow very hard & so easy to climb.

When arrived at BC, Japanese had just fixed the icefall with ladders and rope (paid to Japanese to fix icefall and keep it open), so could go right through. Had good relations with S Pillar Koreans and used each others tents. Koreans fixed ropes on pillar which French used. Pillar route is very good: safe and direct. C4 not in normal place: had left it to Sherpas to pick site, but big mistake as in middle of slope, exposed to wind and uncomfortable. 

24th Sept 1st attempt from C4 by 3 members in cold and windless day and followed Koreans to S summit. Had arrived C4 late and had bad night and Sherpas then sick. Gouvy had to carry snowboard himself; reached 8400m and turned back, exhausted (previous night no sleeping bags and 1 tent). Gouvy descended to C2 on snowboard entire distance from 8400m, highest place anyone started snow band with 2-3 hrs rest in C4; maximum 1 hr snow boarding total. 

25th Flouret tried summit alone from C4 but couldn't find sunglasses for ascent and turned back about 8400-8450m at mid-morning because no glasses and down to C2. 

28th 4 members (De Gayardon's first time using crampons) planning to go up from C4 but descended down in snowstorm and to C2. 2 big avalanches off Lhotse Face but no damage. 

8th Oct 4 members wanted to go up from C4 but again snowing and in clouds and strong wind so down instead (tents at C4 had been destroyed when arrived day before); down to BC 10th Oct. 

Ghilini and Charlet head cold and fever and left BC 13th Oct. Waited in Lobuje to learn about sky diving; decided no chance and expedition over 20th Oct. 1 or 2 Oct the two sky divers left BC by helicopter to come to KTM for sky diving onto summit. Had practiced twice in late Aug in Banepa area, but defense ministry upset (at sometime was too near Boeing jet), so when Gouvy in KTM 2nd Oct, tried to get permit but never obtained; pilot was grounded (and still is).

Abert and Fouques left BC 8th Oct - other commitments.

The team found their South Pillar route on the right of the pillar itself ""very good -- safe and direct."" But their C4 at 7850m was badly sited, they found, in the middle of a slope and so exposed to wind. Although no one reached the summit, one member Bruno Gouvy, carried a snowboard to 8400m on 24 Sept and made a snowboard descent from that altitude (believed to be the highest altitud anyone had ever begun snowboarding) to C2 at 6400m; total elapsed time snowboarding was one hour, but he rested for 2 or 3 hours in C4 on the way down.

At 7800m was just below cold and was very windy which affected his eyes (dried then) because couldn't wear dark goggles at night; eyes painful. ""So I came down BC"" which reached 9:00 am 23rd.

Devouassoux body found at bottom of Icefall; identified by clothing, identification of Chamonix guide and mumified face (body cremated in Khumbu 17 May and ashes scattered).

""I didn't want to stay in mountain like Devouassoux."" Turned back because bad weather and survives. With good weather (no cloud and wind) would have been on summit at 1:00 pm on 23rd and down to South Col.

Route had been changed from S Pillar to normal route before Groselj and Bozic reached BC 15th April. Pillar dry of snow and too dangerous and team of Macedonians not so strong climbers. 5 Sherpas carried loads to Col 5th May and camp pitched 9th May when Bozic, Groselj, Ilievski, Jovcevski, Sonam and Ajiwa arrived there. 10th May 3:00 am 5 men (excluding Jovcevski, who reached col at 11:00 pm on 9th and now too tired) left C4 to go to summit; went very slowly without rope; 3 Yugoslavs used oxygen, Aijwa used only when resting (his bottle really extra one for Ilievski), Sonam none. At first excellent snow conditions, warm, not windy; on narrow ridge to S Summmit bad snow. 4:30 pm at S Summit. Again good conditions and at main summit at 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm (Groselj oxygen finished at S Summit and was lost) and met other 2 Yugoslavs at top of Hillary Step). Sherpas first at C4 at 9:30 pm, Groselj at 2:00 am & Bozic at 2:30 am. Bozic without oxygen from summit and slower than Ilievski, who disappeared at 8500m. Bozic waited at S Col one day and night, very tired but excellent visibility. Down from Col to BC on 12th May. Jovcevski, Groselj and 2 Sherpas to C2 on 11th May. Probably Ilievski fell down E Face. After accident, climb abandoned (some instead in Lhotse attempt).

Only 5 Macedonians reached C3, 2 to C4 [Ilievski and Jovcevski].

Rob Hall, New Zealand expedition leader, said 28 May 1989: the two summit Sherpas on this expedition carried 2 oxygen bottles each for members, but used none themselves while breaking trail through deep snows.

Made BC too early but sirdar convinced McConnell they needed to be first and early in. Took 10 days to make icefall route; icefall in bad shape when team arrived and kept moving throughout season and got worse in mid-May as got warmer; ""last falls"" C1 had become a free standing serac"" says Berg. Had to go to close to W Shoulder which had little snow avalanche but having ice walls were potentially dangerous. Didn't start working on icefall with 2 New Zealanders until 20th March. C1 established 4th April because of bad weather; a bit late making C3 because ran out of ropes. 

1st summit attempt [May 2] from Col at 5:00 am by Berg, Fischer and Jamieson with Berg and Fischer to 27,500 ft and Jamieson to 27,000 ft; turned back by deep snow but nice day. With Sherpa support could have been successful through getting pretty tired already. 

2nd summit bid by McConnell and 3 others but got only to C3. 

Third bid from Col on 14th by Berg, Jamieson and Fischer after 2 nights at col with Roddy Mackenzie (Australian) and Kurt Stuewe (Austrian): at midnight on 13/14th 3 Americans set out for top (Roddy down with toothache, Kurt tired and stayed in Camp) and Jamieson and Berg to 27,500 ft and Fischer to 28,000 ft; turned back cold in poor visibility and tired. Fischer at one point radioed he was lost; Jamieson and Berg back in C4 5:00 am and Fischer at 8:30 am.

Final summit bid on 16th April. From the Col were McConnell, Phu Dorje, Ang Danu and Ricardo Torres Nava but immediately separated: McConnell moved more slowly. Ang Pasang Sherpa who should have been going with McConnell didn't leave Col because of broken crampon. McConnell at 27,000 ft realized had little chance despite its being a mild morning; he was running out strength (had gotten to Col at 5:00 pm 15th) and returned to Col. 3 others got below S Summit and reported 11:30 am would return to Col because of deep snow but decided to go on and summited at 3:30 pm on better terrain; Torres and Ang Danu back at col 6:00 pm and reported Phu Dorje had gone ahead and then disappeared. None of 3 attempts were roped attempts; may have reached 27,500 ft and fallen in their of descent. 

Fischer found a body at base of gullies just above Col - not frozen, had not been there very long because this is avalanche (chute area); must have been Yugoslav because body could have not have been there longer than few days and was a big man.

Sungdare left BC drunk and again drinking at C1; would get out of control. Finally left expedition, 7th or 8th May apparently upset that had been delegated as support for McConnell, whose success was somewhat unlikely. By the time Torres Nava summitted, expedition out of steam; had been at BC 60+ days.

Oxygen used sleeping at C4 (half bottle/man/night) and climbing above C4 by all members and Sherpas.


Van Snick - 26 May 1989

Ricardo is very strong and worked ""very hard"" on expedition - he deserved summit.

Berg, Jamison and Fischer didn't accept him in their summit party and that's why they failed. They needed such a strong man when they found deep snow above Col.

Sat for 1-1/2 hours on glacier just above Col waiting for light because had lost other's headlights and didn't know where to go; got frostbite in right fingers while waiting. When daylight came moved up but was probably 2 hours behind them; reached 27000 ft and then turned back: tired, felt shouldn't be climbing alone. Fell 50-60 ft. Ricardo also fell from S South summit 100 ft and arrested fall with ice axe. Phu Dorje got ahead of Danu below S Summit in clouds. Ricardo behind, fell 100 ft and he and Danu came together. Found Phu Dorje's ice axe upright in snow where Sherpas came up with tea just above C4, Phu Dorje missing. Body seen at about 27,500 ft by Kurt Stuewer, Jay Sieger, Gary Ball, et al later but Danu and Ricardo too late to have daylight to search and next day too tired; other Sherpas did not go up.

Saw body in red jacket and blue pants. Saw body in red face down with red rucksack on back just below old C5 at about 8300m. Yugoslavs now agree that's their missing member.

Phu Dorje to Everest summit last autumn with Americans. Icefall more dangerous than seen in past years says Danu were not roped together. Others besides Ricardo said not to, why Ricardo doesn't know.

Winter winds had taken all snow away and nothing but ice, very hard ice like granite on Lhotse Face, taking lot of energy. Took 19 days to put route through icefall: put in by Hall, Ball, Jamieson, Berg and Fischer plus Sherpas did almost all this job. Started on Pillar and went to 7000m, then decided rock fall danger, especially when Hall and Phinzo Norbu Sherpa were almost hit by batch of rocks coming down from left of Geneva Spur (much safer in Autumn). Reached high point on pillar route on 22nd and 23rd April; retreated to C2, applied by radio for permission to change route and permission granted by radio. 

Made C3 on Lhotse Face on 24th and put gear at Col on 25th but tent not erected. Occupied C4: Ball and Apa (Hall had throat infection, Phinzo blood clot) at same time as snowbirds Ang Zangbu, Peter Hillary and MacKenzie. When Phu Dorje Sherpa died on 16th, Apa and Ang Zangbu no longer willing to climb, so at 11:00 pm 16th the three foreigners [Ball, Hillary and MacKenzie] set out for summit (only Ball without oxygen); reached 8200m.

Many remains of other expeditions at C1 site because safer than using snow slope up from Lho La which have seracs and snow avalanching. Bulgarians and all on West Ridge route thereafter used the same route.

Route to C1 via Khumbutse discussed and decided to use it because snow conditions on Khumbutse were good until the last days of season; and in last days Yugoslavia-Catalan route was also being avalanched.

11th Dec 89: A Polish party this month went to bury the 5 bodies but could find no trace whatsoever; could not find large rock they were near. No ropes left on Khumbutse; had been much avalanching since May, snow was deep. Priest said prayers, items from widows left at site and memorial plaque installed near BC. Party led by Krzysztof Paul, member of spring 1985 Polish Cho Oyu expedition.

Were in couloir Khumbutse going up to return to BC when avalanche came down couloir at 1:00 pm. Going single file up fixed rope. Was 3rd on rope from its top. Chrobak and Gardzielewski changing over lead as avalanche hit at about 6000m, about 500m from top of couloir. Avalanche carried 6 men down to bottom  to glacier and broke ropes - 3 covered by snow; Dasal hanging (dead) on rope, Marciniak and Chrobak not covered. Chrobak in shock near Dasal and could do nothing except go down on his bottom, talking nonsense. Marciniak dug out three others. Heinrich still alive and talking nonsense too; Marciniak put jacket on him. Heinrich died in 15 minutes with broken back and perhaps other injuries. Chrobak kept going down while Marciniak tried to resucitate Otreba, failed then up to Dasal, found him dead, cut rope and body down. ""4"" bodies left where they lay when Marciniak went down to Chrobak already on glacier with broken leg with ribs and back injuries. Marciniak put him in sleeping bag on platform; 2 men slept in sleeping bags in open that night. During night 2nd avalanche danger same couloir, Marciniak got himself out of snow got Chrobak out of slight snow cover. Chrobak still alive, Marciniak could scarcely talk but put another sleeping bag on Chrobak and pulled him down 40m. Was snowing now but Marciniak happy they are two alive, but when Marciniak went to Chrobak after radio contact with BC, saw sleeping bag not on Chrobak; tried to talk to Chrobak but no answer as Chrobak died in his sleeping position; must have died during night. Marciniak made snowhole for his own shelter, waiting for rescue from BC, from which about 6 people tried to go up to him on 28th but could not because snowing and avalanching. So BC advised him to go to C1, which was not at Lho La but at 5800m on Rongbuk Glacier just north of point 6145m on National Geographic map. Left snowhole at 1:00 pm and reached C1 in night 28th May, took long time to find camp because in thick cloud/mist. At C1 could now have his first tea (after drinking water on top of tent) since avalanche. By now was snowblind but a little vision. Was alone till rescuer reached him on 1 June morning. He had decided to go towards Rongbuk monastery; had no food and fuel left C1 to walk to Rongbuk monastery and was about to leave when rescuers arrived. When he was dreaming or hallucinating but went out of tent to look, saw figure not clearly and they saw him. They embraced. He felt weak but walked all the way to Chinese BC, where Chinese truck waited.

Lost lot of weight, how much don't know (Hajer says 7-8 kgs)

Hajer - KTM/C1 5 hours, from midnight 29 May - 8 hours trek from BC
and returned KTM 11:00 pm 2nd June.

Gary checked Marciniak's body and Marciniak started down immediately.


Ang Tshering, Asian Trekking - 1 June 89

Rescue team arrived at La 7:00 am. Polish weak but no danger of death. Arrives Rongbuk monastery this eve where vehicle is. Hope Chinese mail helicopter from Rongbuk to Zhangmu and Asian trekking sending small boy to border this evening. 6 left BC about 10:00 am.


Peter Hillary - 1 June 1989

Peter left BC late on 27 May after news of Polish disaster had been received at BC.

2 summiters coming down from top and 4 supporters met them probably on 25th at C3. 6 down to C1 at night end of Lho La. On 27th terrible snow conditions. 27th took 2-1/2 hours from C1 to find bottom fixed rope on Khumbutse started up Khumbutse and were hit by avalanche off Khumbutse's East Face in early afternoon of 27th. 1 man broken ankle and shock and unable to talk, other broken ribs. These 2 dug out a body and tried to recusitate but failed.

When Peter left BC 2 were left lying out without tent, could be that Marciniak returned to C1.


Messner - 29 May 1989

Rob Hall, Gary Bull, Artur Hajzer and a Sherpa leave KTM midnight tonight by road to north side of Everest BC, which they expect to reach in 2 days to bring Marciniak from Lho La camp. He is snowblind and his broken ribs but walking. Took this route to reach him because of avalanching down steep slopes to Nepalese side.

First made route on Lhotse Face with Koreans. Made C3 at 7250m and C4 just under chimmney leading to summit at 7900m where spent only couple of hours. Left at 10:00pm, climbed during night and on Lhotse summit 6:00 am 28th Sept. Just and Becik only to summit. Bozik and Jasko stayed at C4, saving Lhotse top for after Everest after descending to S Col. Lhotse used primarily for acclimatization. All 4 descended to C2 on 28th and down to BC 29th for rest. No camps or ropes put on Everest SW Face. 

1st Everest summit bid on 7th Oct defeated by wind before got above C2. 12th left BC and 14th started on SW Face at 3:00 am: 4 climbers with inner lining of 1 tent, 2 sleeping bags (for the 2 intending to go to Lhotse afterwards), food for 3 days, cooking stove and gas, 240-m pieces of climbing ropes, 4 ice axes, 2 ice hammers, 3 small cameras and 1 light video camera. 14th Oct 1st bived at 7:00 pm, 15th arrived 2nd biv at 5:00 pm feeling fine and weather good. Had planned to climb couloir 1st day but more hard ice and more technically difficult than they had expected. 16th to 3rd biv at 7:00 pm but took 2-1/2 hrs to build platform there. Had taken long time crossing snowfield, which took whole day. Fiala now feared something wrong. One member now sick and exhausted (Becik) but they continued up because felt it impossible to descend couloir they had exited. 17th 9 am, 4 men started towards S Summit, which they should reach at 10:00 and main summit at 11:00 am. 13:40 radio contact Just said he was now on main summit alone, Becik not well day before decided not to try for it and was waiting below S Summit; other 2: he did not know whether they trying for top or descending to col. Just on top 15-20 min, said extremely cold and windy. 15:00 hrs next contact; Just said now to S Summit, Becik not there and other 2 not seen, probably on way to col; Just having problems with vision (probably retinal hemorrhage). 16:00 hrs Just said he met other 3, then 5 mins later said Becik missing; Bozik and Jasko, he said, had same problems with vision and feeling lost; Jasko also lethargic and had to be persuaded to go on. 17:30 hrs Just said Becik reached them from above and Becik in best condition (could see properly); they found orientation and were midway from S Summit to Col and all OK [at 8300m], could see the way; will give more info in 2 hrs when at S Col. This was last contact with these 4 men. Americans reached Col at 18:00-18:30 in good visibility and could see entire route to S Summit but no nobody, no headlamps in the dark til late at night; at 23:00 hrs wind got very strong (100 mph, Americans said); at C2 4 of 7 tents torn apart in shreds - probably were blown off ridge down E Face.

""One of the most serious attempts on Everest"" says Fiala; hardest attempt to climb in Himalaya.

Team's four strong climbers acclimatized on Lhotse's West Face, and two, Just and Becik, climbed during the night of 27/28 September to Lhotse's summit. Then to the Bonington route on Everest's SW Face without fixed camps, fixed rope, Sherpa helpers or bottled oxygen which they began at 3:00 am on 14 Oct carrying minimal gear. On first day did not make expected progress: more hard ice and greather technical difficulties than anticipated. On third day moved very slowly, spent whole day crossing snowfield. Becik now sick and exhausted, but continued up because would be unable to descend the face and must descend via South Summit-South Col.

This party were officially members of the Czechoslovak team to the SW Face, but they were actually a separate group. They went up Lhotse's West Face to acclimatize, then Ball, Hall and Atkinson ascended the South Pillar with Ball gaining a high point of 8100m on 12 October. The woman member, Lydia Bradey, did not attempt the pillar, went up only the Lhotse Face, reached the South Col, was seen at the South Summit and said she got to the summit by herself on the 14th. Her claim was disputed by others, including the New Zealanders, who even issued a statement saying she could not have done so, but a Spaniard who summited on the same day as she says she did, believes her detailed account. She was the first woman to scale Everest without bottled oxygen.

Ball to 7800m on Lhotse on 27th Sept and Bradey to same altitude on 30th for acclimatization. 12th Oct Ball, Atkinson and Hall went to Korean's C3 on S Pillar route on 7500m; Ball alone to 8100m on same day at bottom of SE Ridge. 13th Oct Bradey to Col and 14th above Col (left Col 2:00 am and on S Summit 2:30 pm on hands and knees (seen by Spaniards there). Hall, Ball and Atkinson left BC on 14th. Reported by radio at BC that Bradey reached BC safely and without frostbite, but whether she summited or not was not reported. Later she claimed success, but doubted by other NZers and Spaniards.

NZers really were reported by team from Czechoslovakia: relations were not good since NZers paid $25,000 to participate in the climb with Czechs to provide all gear, food, etc., but gear badly delayed on shipping and this, NZers feel, cost them the summit.

NZers had no intention of climbing on the middle of SW Face like the Czechs, but to follow the Korean's Pillar route after the Koreans finished. NZers asked Tourism Ministry for permission to climb via S Col and this was refused. Bradey went to Col in defiance of this written refusal.


Bradey - 3 Nov 1988

Bradey is now not claiming summit because she believes penalty against her will be lighter than if she did press her claim. Still has no doubt that she reached summit, but she has given Tourism Ministry a statement that she may have been confused.


Lydia Bradey - 1 Nov 1988

12 Oct - BC to C2.

13 Oct - C2 to C4 where shared a tent with a Frenchman Denis of TV group.

14 Oct - 2:00 am left C4 at same time as several Spaniards and Ang Rita and another Sherpa. They moved well ahead of her while she proceeded slowly. She saw them far ahead just below S Summit (time not known since had lost her watch). They went out of sight and she took a long time to climb the ridge to South Summit, rested and daydreamed, then realized she was losing lot to time and began to move again. Tried to move quickly and got to S Summit at about 3:00 pm (Spanish said it was about this time) and sat down. Spanish were on the way down and had a walkie-talkie; one asked her what her name was, but she didn't want them talking about her on the radio, didn't want people at that time knowing what she was doing. Spanish said ""should go down"" and she was thinking slowly about going on up or down and decided to try going up. Spanish party moved on down while she went up. She kept trying to have pattern of steps and breathing and didn't sit down to rest any more. Walked up Hillary Step which has some rope and steps, then around the left of a crevasse and on to summit where saw nothing. Was there at about 5:00 pm. Rested sitting down very few minutes and then down (left nothing there). Constantly moved down to 8200m (she faced out almost all of the way) after moving more slowly with rests. Spanish 3/4 hour ahead of her at C4 at Col; they said she arrived at 8:30 pm, 1/2 hr after night fall. Spent night in same tent but alone after heating snow to drink.

15 Oct - through C3 where met Americans and on to C2.

16 Oct - to BC by lunch time. When arrived at Spanish tent at col to ask way to her, had all gloves and overboots, not missing anything watch, took 15+ and minutes to go slowly and carefully to her tent.

""It was there in the moon"" and I wanted to try. S Col was only route had equipment on. Had some in C2 and were in C4. Had ambition to be 1st woman without oxygen on Everest summit but feeling inside wanting to climb that motivated her.


Belvis, Spanish Everest - 28 Oct 1988

Spanish summiters descending from summit met Lydia Bradey 100m below S Summit. She was on her hands and knees going up. She returned to S Col at same time as Spaniards, who moved very slowly because they were taking a frostbitten teammate who had stopped on the way up.


Frush and Allison, US Everest - 27 Oct 1988

Serious doubt that Lydia Bradey actually reached summit of Everest on 14 Oct. Spaniards descending met her on hands and knees near South Summit on her way up. She returned to S Col 1/2 to 1 hour after Spaniards [when she returned she was minus a gaiter and 2 gloves but not frostbitten - from a NZer not on her team]. Very unlikely at all one could get up Hillary Step on hands and knees.


Lluis Giner - 16 Oct 1992
Spanish Everest Summiter in Oct 1988

He believes Bradey reached main summit of Everest. He descended to C3 same day as she and they went to C2 together, talked in detail about problems of final ascent and she must have done it herself, not merely read about it.


10 Nov - Agony and Acrimony at the Top of the World, by Richard Cowper (Financial Times) (Excerpted paragraphs)

A New Zealander claims to have made mountaineering history by becoming the first woman to have climbed Everest without oxygen. No one disputes she got to within 200m of the summit, but few believe she got much higher. Her claim has given rise to bitter and protracted argument.
....

Enough doubt was cast on the validity of Bradey's claim to have reached the top of Everest to ensure it was never officially accepted by any of the world's recognised climbing authorities. But, two years on, new evidence I have collected from four members of the Catalan expedition - and from tapes of walkie-talkie conversations between them and base camp - suggests that she was telling the truth.
...

Deeply angered by her lack of team spirit and the 'selfishness' of her lone attempt on a route for which the New Zealander did not have permission, Hall feared the whole team would be banned from climbing in Nepal and he did much to undermine Bradey's credibility. In statements made to the Nepalese authorities and to the New Zealand Press Association he accused her of 'irresponsible misconduct' and of making 'ficticious' claims.

In an attempt to ensure that he, Gary Ball and Bill Atkinson escaped penalty for Bradey's action he wrote disassociating the team from her 'illegal foray' and alleged that information about her physical condition and the timing of her movements from the Spanish climbers on the South Col route at the same time made it clear she could never have reached the top.
...

Bradey seemed to do little to substantiate her claim and much to undermine it. She had carried no watch to ascertain the times at which she reached crucial stages of the climb, had no photographic proof of her ascent, and had made enemies in unfortunate places. Least helpful of all, when she got back to Kathmandu she temporarily withdrew her claim to have reached the top.

Nevertheless she does have plausible explanations for everything she did.
...

The Catalans were reported by the three New Zealanders to have radioed base camp at 2:30pm on the afternoon of October 14 to let them know they had 'met Bradey 100m below the South Summit crawling on her hands and knees in 'distress.' Fearing for her life, Ang Rita, a Sherpa, who had just made history by ascending Everest for the fifth time, tried to persuade her to come down but she refused. Bradey's compatriots were told of the content of the radio call at base camp and chose this point to leave the mountain altogether.

Later the New Zealanders reported the Spanish as saying Bradey had returned to the South Col camp between 6:30 pm and 7 pm on the evening of October 14. If these statments are correct Bradey could not have possibly climbed the mountain in the time available.

But the Catalans never made a formal statement to the authorities and new evidence gleaned from their diaries, the recorded tapes of conversations between the climbers and base camp and the memories of those on the mountain at the time, shows up startling differences from the New Zealand account.

Jeronimo Lopez, one of the Catalans who climbed to the summit that day and who met Lydia on the descent, has attempted to set the record straight.

""I have talked the issue over in detail with Lluis Giner, who listened to all the tapes again, Sergio Martinez and Josef Casanovas, the deputy leader who was in base camp on October 14 and operated the radio. We now agree that: The meeting with Bradey took place on the South Summit at around 2:30 pm when a radio call was made and not 100m below it. (This 100m is crucial to whether you believe Bradey had enough time to climb Everest, because at that altitude 100m could take two hours to climb). Bradey was in poor condition and Lopez asked her to retreat. We saw her crawling but, in retrospect, this may have been because she was resting. We are adamant she was not in 'distress,' although we understand that Ang Rita told her she would die if she tried to go to the top.

Nil Bohigas made a rapid descent in about 2 hours arriving at the South Col at about 5 pm, four hours before the rest. (This may account for some confusion in the reports made by the New Zealanders). On the way down Bradey overtook Martinez (the injured Spaniard), Giner and myself at around 8:30 pm at 8200m. We arrived back at the South Col Camp at 9:30 pm about half an hour after Bradey.""

If these times are right (and they come from three out of the four Catalans on the mountain at the time) then Bradey had roughly 6-1/2 hours to climb from the South Summit to the top and back down again, not the four hours suggested by the New Zealanders, a feat within the bounds of possibility for a strong climber, though not at all easy without oxygen.

Says Elizabeth Hawley, doyenne of mountaineering in Nepal and someone who has followed the case closely: ""She's a very strong climber. She would be physically capable. She is in the Wanda (Wanda Rutkiewicz: the world's top woman mountaineer) class and ten years younger."" Bradey's own version of the crucial stages of the climb now becomes more likely: ""I was not delirious. I wasn't hallucinating. When the Spanish left the South Summit I was on my own. I just took it stage by stage. There was some rope on Hillary Step. I used it to help me up. I presume it took me about 1-1/2 hours, maybe two hours, to the main summit. I don't really know.

I probably got to the top about 5:30 pm. I hardly stayed any time at all.
 
Then I was back down at the South Col around 8:30 pm. Heaps of people climbed Everest that season. It was no big deal. There were large bucket steps for me to follow. There were holes for ice axes. It wasn't like Messner soloing."" Even if the 'new' Spanish times are accepted some experts remain uncertain.

One authority says: ""She appears to have got stronger rather than weaker as she went up. Normally at that altitude you are getting worse. In my book I must place a question mark against her ascent. I don't know whether she herself even knows whether she got to the top. It will probably remain a mystery."" Others give her the benefit of the doubt. Says Doug Scott, Britain's most successful mountaineer: ""After communicating with Lydia I am convinced she did it. She's a phenomenal climber. She's a big girl. She's strong. The timing is just possible for someone that good ... She strikes me as the sort of person who would not lie about this. I do not think she would risk the damage to her self esteem.""",None,1st woman atop Everest without oxygen,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453397,

            oxygen were at 8500m when Batard saw them; Batard vomitted
            here: from Col to top to BC couldn't eat or drink; had not
            recovered strength from 2nd attempt; without this problem 
            would have made it to top in less than 20 hours.
          - left Col 8:30 am and climbed alone in ""good track"" of 
            Koreans and French and on top at 3:30 pm; also on top were 
            French. Batard stayed 20-30 minutes and down.
          - stopped at Col because of sickness; still could not drink
            without vomiting; arrived at BC 6:30 pm
27 Sept   - left Col 6:00 am and stopped in US C2, etc; left BC 12 
            noon and left BC 2:00 pm to Lobuje
28 Sept   - arrived KTM


Benoit Chamoux - 7 Aug 1988

Batard is very strong; is capable of doing ""express ascents"" between South Col route is very long and much depends on how much trail breaking he must do as well as weather and health.
1st to do ""express ascent"" (Chamonix term) was Krzyztof Wielicki in 23 hours to summit (but not down) in 1981
Chamoux only other:
23 hours up Nanga Parbat
23 hours up K2
23 hours up and down Broad Peak (16 hours up) 
routes mostly already established by him and others


EP Hillary - 28 July 1988

""A partly fair effort"" if Batard and/or Sungdare 24 hours BC-top-BC.

""If in the report, it was made quite clear route established halfway up Lhotse Face, I'd be quite impressed; but if report does not mention all difficult routes established then not so impressed.""


EP Hillary - 18 March 1988

""Pretty unusual, wish them luck - more legitimate activity - would be remarkable effort - only reservation I would have: I'd be much more impressed if trip up mountain not on fixed ropes put in for him.""

Problem with team: had to wait till 7th Oct to start summit push from BC until TV program ready (satellite booked until Olympic games ended on 2nd Oct). Had been to altitude to acclimatize already. On 6th Oct it snowed but started on 7th Oct from BC planning to go to C2 that day, to C4 on S Col on 8th and 9th to top, but very windy weather (C1 one of 2 tents blown away and at C2 2 tents broken). 6 members and 10 Sherpas in C2 on 7-11 Oct (during very windy days). 11th evening winds lessened and 12th all to S Col (4 Sherpas went ahead by 3 hrs to place more tents and descended because said not possible to pitch tents). 1 member descended early that day and others did not reach S Col. Koenig and same Sherpas first on Col and actually 3 members and 5 Sherpas slept at Col in US tent (4 men from Spanish team also). 13th too windy and cold to start up till 7:30 am. Koenig and Lhakpa Sonam went up (using oxygen to ensure TV from top) carrying cameras and antenna; 1 hr later Galy and Pasang Temba also started up from Col. Koenig and Lhakpa on top at 1:15 pm (made direct radio from S Summit but on summit a cable was broken so no picture possible but radio OK). Left camera at top for next day's summiters. Very dangerous snow slab conditions above S Summit. Both descended after 10 min and met Pasang below S Summit (Galy had descended from 8500m). Told Pasang too late for him to go to top but he wanted to get to summit as his brother Lhakpa had just done. Both Koenig and Lhakpa carried on down. At 8500m Lhakpa stopped, Koenig assumes waiting for Pasang. Koening at Col 4:30 pm. Pasang not seen beyond S Summit but think he got to top because so late to descend (Koenig looking all afternoon-evening for Sherpas to be seen descending but not seen until night fall) though maybe got into US tent during night. 

2:00 am on 14th 4 Spanish, 2 Spanish Sherpas, 1 NZ woman (without oxygen), Ducroz and 1 TV Sherpa started up from S Col. At 3:30 am TV Sherpa came back saying 2 dead Sherpas (but sounded like bad Sherpas) and 4 am Ducroz reported were 2 dead men. He turned back unwilling to take pictures on mountain with 2 dead people on it, but others continued up. Koenig and Ducroz up later that morning and brought bodies to Col and later to C2, early put into crevasse in sleeping bags. Lhakpa and Pasang had fallen (but were not roped together); Lhakpa had broken skull and Pasang many broken bones and clothes ripped off.

No more summit attempts because TV programme finished on 15th and had to wait through period of good weather.

Koenig parapented from Lho La to BC; had wanted to fly from S Col or above but camera came first, then 2 dead.

Spanish Sherpas refused to let French TV Sherpas on W Ridge; could not follow alpine-style climbers on SW Face when burdened with camera and sound equipment. 

This expedition was restricted by a contract for live telecast of the climb which could not be aired until satellite space was available after end of Olympic Games, which meant angry climbers had to wait until 7 October for their summit push and wasted days of good climbing weather. When satellite was available, winds had become fierce, tents were blown away or broken, and climbers spent four nights in C2 awaiting break in winds. In the end only leader and Lhakpa Sonam Sherpa gained the summit on the 13th (perhaps another Sherpa, Pasang Temba, did also alone) and both Sherpas had fatal falls in descent.

C1 made quickly because Americans had already nearly finished putting in route (for which paid Americans $3500 and similar amount to Koreans). Spent 1-1/2 hrs on top to take photos and Boivin's parapente flight of 12 mins from summit to C2 (took time to get wind properly in his parapente for take off). No ski descent (Batard had ordered Sherpa to throw most of skis in river below BC and LO said all such descents forbidden). Only one summit bid because had to leave BC 28th Sept for jobs back in France (and to be in France same time as Batard to get share of publicity).

Batard arrived at summit while Metzger, et al still there. 

Batard and Poissonnier did not speak to each other; enmity originated in Dec 1987 when Batard ended Dhaulagiri I climb before Poissonnier and others were ready to climb.

From 12th to 27th Sept were stocking higher camps without occupying them and sent people down to rest; had problems getting Sherpas to work. 

Allison, Ruoss, Frush and 3 Sherpas in 1st summit team and occupied C3 and C4 first. Planned these 3 Sherpas would carry extra oxygen as they all set out from Col just after midnight of 28th with Frush and Pasang Gyalzen breaking trail (Frush found snow up to his waist) and took 6 hours to 8500m where intended to change bottles; 2 of 3 Sherpas, Frush now discovered, had turned back very soon after leaving C4 (one complained of tight gaiters and other went with him). Now oxygen supply only good for 4 people for 2 hours and knew would take at least 4 hours so Frush and Ruoss gave extra supply carried by Pasang Gyalzen to Allison. Although Frush and Ruoss felt fine, they felt it better not to try oxygenless ascent and thought would have another chance. 

2nd summit bid was by Tabin, Luce and 3 more Sherpas. 

Never got a team past C3 after this: storm came along on 4th Oct with strong winds. Frush got mild frostbite so could go up only in gentle weather. Frush left BC 14 Oct and when he left 5 climbers were in C2 hoping for summit push.


Added data

Hambly, Goodman and Dailey on South Col 16 Oct but weather terrible and they went down next day with some frostbite. Petroske and Ruoss twice to C3 and then summit bids had been aborted (1) when French threw 2 Sherpa bodies down face and (2) need to help frostbitten Spaniards descend.

1988 Korean Everest-Lhotse Expedition by San-Ak In

KAF's Everest-Lhotse Expedition has been organized with the memory of the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games for its main object.

BC was firstly established by the advance party on Aug 9th. On the way to C2, they advanced through the Icefall in partnership with the American Expedition. Weather had been bad after C2 was built up on Sept 7th, so that from Sept 9th, all the members had recess at BC and C1.

C3 of 1 box tent was arranged on snow face after cutting the 60-degree slope of surface, which was about 500m upward over the rock. It was South Ridge end.

By Sept 18th, the ropes were fixed to the height of 7800m. Next day they established C4.

Then a selection was made for the first attack. Climbing leader Mr. Seon-Woo Nam and member Chang-Seon Kim, Hong-Gil Uhm started BC on Sept 24th with Pema Dorji and 2 other Sherpas. From C2 to C4, they should cover 1660m of altitudinal differrence in a day. Leader Nam climbed down in bad condition, while the pair Kim and Uhm started for C4 with 2 Sherpas on Sept 26th.

Ahead on 7 French members they proceeded their route to S Summit through deep snow. Arrived at S Summit at 12:15 pm. Alternating in the lead, the French and the Korean climbers went on. Finally at 2:30 pm, member Kim and Pema Dorje firstly stood on the summit. Member Uhm reached at once, even the other Sherpa went back around the South Summit.

The second attempt was followed from BC on Sept. 27. Starting C4 at 3:40 am, Mr. Bong-Wan Jang (subleader), Byeong-Ho Jang and Seung-Kyon Jeong again conquered the summit at 8:50 am. It was Sept 29th. On the top, they recorded those wonderful panoramic views on a videotape with them, where they came across an American climber Alison.

The third attempt was timely planned for the closing of the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games - to win both Everest and Lhotse at the same time. Based on the expectation of the summit on Oct 2nd, the both parties departed from BC on Sept 30th.

The Lhotse party (member Ho-Jin Jeong, Hyeong-Chil Lim, Kwae-Don Park and Hee-Dong Park) stayed at C4 on Oct 1 in two tents. One was already built and used by Czechoslovak climbers who previously conquered the summit on Sept 28th and the other was newly established by themselves.

Mr. Seon-Woo Nam, the climbing leader, spent that night alone at Everest C4 with his great ambition to climb up solo. At 3:00 am in the next dawn, he started. Following the ropes fixed by the first party, he climbed the Hillary Step and overcame the Peak Cornice. Then he finally gained the summit.

On the other hand, the Lhotse party started at 4:00 am on the same day. They passed over the unstable and steep couloir (500 meters long) without using the ropes for belaying. After more than 5 hours of climbing, they could just over come the last obstacle - the snow face of 30 meters long with 65-degree slope. The summit was all pointed.

Yamada & Saito, (Japanese Everest expedition) - 17 Nov 85

Indians failed on Everest because
1) Had army mentality - if members killed, send in more from Delhi.
2) Leadership did not understand how to climb Himalaya. Logistics bad.
   Members and Sherpas became very tired, leader did not understand this.
   Did not get into position to take advantage of good weather brief periods.


Prem Chand - 12 Nov 85

1 members and 1 Nepal Sherpa left Col for summit to return back to Col. Left 4:30 am (5 members and 1 Sherpa) plus K. I. Kumar and Bakshi.

7th Oct summit party turned back about 2:30 because visability deteriorating so badly almost whiteout (12:30 weather turned bad) and deep snow making slow progress.

K. I. Kumar at 2:00 pm radioed had lost goggles and oxygen bladder punctured. Told to come back. 3:30 Bakshi says Kumar has slipped 1500 ft and plus send rescue doctor, was told to stay where he was to wait for ND Sherpa's party. Bakshi saw him slip out of sight - body ended at Cwm seen sliding by kitchen boy.

All others of summit party returned to South Col that afternoon, now 14 people in C4.


Oct 8 - ND Sherpa, Rinzing and Lalit and others started down but 2 returned to Col. ND Sherpa and 7 actually came down leaving 6 in Col camp.

Oct 9 - 2 more came down: Rinzing and Lalit came while others started, returned to Col probably because Bakshi's condition. Bahuguna that afternoon indicated rescue needed and told would be sent on 10th

Oct 10 - rescue party started up Lhotse face but high winds, snowstorms.

Oct 11 - at 4:30 pm 1 member, 2 Sherpas reached Col. Bakshi and Dr Negi died, Bahuguna couldn't speak and soon collapsed. Roa asked for water. Sherpas left because late, feared for their lives. I.B. Gurung brought Rao to slabs short of Col, slipped, put body down (now not talking), and ordered to anchored body and descend - his body probably came down in avalanche. Later one body stuck in crevasse, others also not recovered.

Oct 12 - all in BC.

Oct 14 - started up, got to C1 and C2 and then again bad snowstorm.
Oct 20 - again started up


Summit attempt:

Oct 2 - Sherpas only dumped loads at Geneva Spur, nowhere moved loads to Col and descended.

Oct 8  - Never left Col

Oct 27 - left Col, got to 27,000 ft and dumped stores there - strong 
         prevented push to top.
Oct 28 - another party including Busa left Col, approached dump. 
         Angchuk lost his balance, slipped, pulled Bissa with him - 
         stopped at snowfall above Col, Bissa injured knee. Retreated 
         to Col and below. No one returned to Col on this expedition.
         Had planned to send men to Col to retrieve bodies but Japanese
         did this: pushed bodies down on 29th.
Oct 28 - Prem Chand knew his team could make no more summit bids and 
         told Japanese then could go up. Formal decision to call off 
         climb had to come from Delhi and chief was away, so 5 Nov this 
         decision taken in Delhi.

(this was only decision made in Delhi and was actually only a formality).

Another party up from Col 28th and when reached summit camp one slipped and pulled other towards South Col field and saved. Now resources exhausted. 

Death at South Col: Oxygen supply plentiful, nations still there and fuel and burners also still there. Could not find fixed rope and once blizzard started couldn't move. Kumar slipped in blizzard when could not find the way.

Rescue attempted: requested by Bahuguna 9th evening and sent 10th but wind pushed them back and faces covered with layer of ice which peeled off. 11th party reached Col, 2 dead, Bahuguna died soon, Rao alive at 4:30 pm when one member and 2 Sherpas reached him. Tried to carry him down: brought him to slabs of South Col, slipped and was ordered to anchor him and descend. He was not speaking: don't know whether he was alive or dead.

6 Oct 7 members and 1 Sherpa 
7 Oct 6 members and 1 Sherpa arrived to join then (but one dead now).

Japanese succeeded by striking period of lull in winds: very lucky - used Indian ropes. Indians opened route 3 times.

Cause of death - exposure and in one case exhaustion (Bakshi). Don't know why they died because camp well stocked, but weather bad. Don't know whether they were in condition to look after themselves at South Col 7-11 Oct.

No major decisions made in Delhi. I was leader (head of Army Adventure says none during either leadership)

5 Nov called off the climb.

Prem Chand resumed leadership as soon as he was found fit. Had broken arm bone in bus accident. Progress on SW Face extremely good. ""Only when weather collapsed"" they gave up face.


Yagihara (Japanese Everest)

Indians gave up 28 Oct and Prem Chand to KTM by helicopter. 2 Oct only 4 members left in BC with Sherpas.

6 summit attempts. 7 Oct was 1st one. After this disastrous one, no more attempts to climb face.

7 Oct Kumar fell; others stayed at C4 in Col. 28 Oct last summit bid tried to make C5 and reached 8500-8600m. Sherpas dumped supplies 27 Oct but next day the 2 members who went up couldn't find cache and Prem Chand at C2 decided no more climbing attempts.

29 Oct 3 bodies through down Lhotse face (other body couldn't find) by Yagihara's  party.

Indian team could not make decisions. All decisions made in Delhi by a General (neither Jagit Singh nor Prem Chand could decide).


Tourism - 29 Oct 85
 
Yesterday all camps very high wind till late night. Most tents damaged. Today weather fair and mild wind at BC.

Ang Chuk of 2nd summit party blown off in high wind at 14:30 hours yesterday in process of occuping South Summit camp at 27,600 ft. Along with him Bissa also slipped as both roped together. Bissa tried to arrest his slip with ice axe but both continued rolling and fell 700 ft down slope. Luckily they stopped in snow at South Col. Ang Chuk unharmed but Bissa minor injuries. Both escorted to lower camps by other members. 

9 Sherpas ferried to C1.


Tourism Ministry - 18 Oct 85

5 members and 4 Sherpas of C2 and 7 members and 17 Sherpas of C1 could not came down yesterday because of bad weather with heavy snowfall and poor visibility.  All the members and Sherpas of both camps are moving down to BC today. C1 and C2 are fully stocked. Because of heavy snowfall all the routes are covered by snow. In the BC there is about 4 ft deep snow. Some members and Sherpas are going up to open the route between BC and C1. 


Tourism Ministry - 16 Oct 85

3 members and 4 Sherpas reoccupied C1 on 15 Oct and held up there today by bad weather. Today 4 members and 10 Sherpas moved to C1 from BC to stock and restore while 2 other members and 6 Sherpas moved to C2 from C1 to stock and restore. If weather permits C3 will also be restored.


Tousism Ministry - 8 Oct 85

KI Kumar died 15:30 hrs yesterday. He and other 7 occupied South Col camp on Oct 6 for attempt on summit. At 4:00 am 7 Oct party got up to get ready, wind was strong and waited for it to subside. After 6:00 am wind dropped all 8 except Kumar and Bakshi started up at 6 am while Kumar and Bakshi set out 6:40 am and before left confirmed all in good health.

10:45 am ND Sherpa radioed to expedition but two later men did not come on radio. ND Sherpa was just short of South Summit; snow conditions Ok but wind speed increasing. ND Sherpa and his 5 companions were fit and confident of reaching top in 3-4 hours. ND Sherpa could not see Kumar and Bakshi - mist between the two parties.

Kumar on radio at 14:00 hours reported had reached South Summit, weather deterioration fast, snow was soft and wind speed increasing. Should they go on BC said no since could not reach Col again safely before dark.

15:00 hours KI Kumar came on radio and said his oxygen mask leaking from puncture, snow googles fallen off weather cloudy and strong wind but still insisted in going on up and would make South Summit in 1-1/2 hours. BC said go down, but wait for ND's party to descend to him.

15:30 hours Bakshi on radio: Kumar slipped at least 1500 ft between South Summit at South Col towards South Col side. At same time kitchen boy in C2 told Lt Col Puskar Chand he saw red object coming Lhotse slope just below Geneva Spur next to bergschrund. Chand rushed to site with all available help.

17:00 hours Chand told Brig. leader that Kumar was dead: fallen more than 4000 ft down Lhotse Face leading to multiple injuries to head and body.

SW face progress stopped today South col people down to C2 today.


Prem Chand - 12 Nov 85

7 members and 1 Nepali Sherpa left Col for summit to return back to Col; left 4:30 am (5 members and 1 Sherpa) plus Kumra and Bakshi 45 minutes later.
Next summit up from C3 to Col - arrived at about 2:00-3:00 pm
7th Oct summit party turned back about 2:30 because visibility deteriorating so badly almost white out (12:30 weather turnd bad) and deep snow making slow progress.

K I Kumar at 2:00 pm radioed had last goggles and oxygen bladder punctured, told to come back 3:30 Bakshi says Kumar has slipped 1500 ft and please send rescue doctor, was told to stay where he was to wait for ND Sherpas party. Bakshi saw him slip out of sight; body ended at Cwm seen sliding by kitchen boy.

All others of summit party returned to South Col that afternoon, now 14 people in C4.

1985 American Mount Everest West Ridge Expedition Report
The Climb

Our advance party had already spent several days working to find and fix a route up the 2000 ft of rock that formed the Lho La wall. In a daring and risky maneuver, Jim Bridwell, Andy Politz, and Kevin Swigert ascended a steep avalanche chute and several precariously hanging ice seracs to reach the top of the Lho La wall at 20,000 ft. Once on top, they fixed ropes down a near vertical section of rock that blocked the upper 500 ft of the Lho La wall. Now our efforts turned to reinforcing the route and beginning the time consuming process of moving over 10,000 pounds of gear up the mountain.

On March 17 Kevin Swigert and Jay Smith made our first attempt to establish a camp on the Lho La. Although they successfully reached the Lho La and pitched a tent there, the gale force winds blowing out of Tibet wreaked havoc on them. From BC the winds sounded like a never ending freight train roaring out of Tibet. For Jay and Kevin the winds meant a sleepless night as they tried desperately to keep the tent from collapsing or blowing away. Finally, in the cold predawn hours they decided to abandon their percarious position and descend to BC. Their fate was a gentle reminder to all of us of the force Everest could muster against us.

Two days later we successfully moved people to the Lho La and began establishing Camp I on the flat white expanse of the Rongbuk Glacier that stretches for miles into the far reaches of Tibet. Camp I soon expanded to include 15 tents complete with underground kitchen and our famous White House.

We soon began to probe across the mile of the Rongbuk Glacier that separated us from the steep slopes of Everest Western Shoulder. Our lead climbers carefully found a route across the glacier that avoided the hidden crevasses and located a snow bridge that crossed the bergschrund at the base of the Western Shoulder.
Meanwhile, everyone else concentrated on carrying loads to C1 and acclimatizing to the higher elevations. Climbing Everest in not at all glamour, it is mostly routine and exhausting work. Climbing Everest is like building a pyramid. Our team began with 30,000 pounds of gear at Base Camp and ended up with a single tent, 2 sleeping bags, 2 stoves, 6 oxygen bottles, food and miscellaneous equipment at 27,000 ft for two climbers to be in a position to go for the summit. Our climb was a team effort, whether you were going for the summit or fixing meals.

We pushed the route up the steep ice slopes of the Western Shoulder, then into a  narrow ice gully, across the downsloping rocks of the rock band, and into the snow fields at about 22,000 ft. On March 29, with a Pete Athens in the lead, we discovered the snow-filled entrance to the remnant of the French Winter Expedition's snow cave at 22,500 ft that would become C2 for us. Hard work and the constant chipping out of ice from the walls to melt into cooking water soon enlarged it to handle six people comfortably. We welcomed the protection of the cave against the nearly constant winds blowing across the shoulder. But the protection of the cave also could become dangerous. During the last several weeks of the climb, as snow fell every day, we had several close calls when the entrance would be covered with blowing snow and the sleeping climbers inside would awaken with headaches and sickness from near suffocation.

The steep carry from C1 to C2 along our fixed ropes typically took us about six hours up and two hours down, although our Sherpas did it in about half that time. With our usual weather pattern, you would leave C1 in the still warmth of the morning sun, usually stopping to peel off layers of clothing before beginning the steep ice ascent. By noon, however, those same layers were put on again as the afternoon winds, clouds and snow arose. When the weather shifted each day, the temperature plummeted and the winds became a feared enemy.

As we continued to ferry loads from BC to C1 and C2, our rotating terms of climbers worked to push the route up the snow and ice above C2 towards C3 and the West Ridge. We soon fixed ropes above C2 to the crest of the northern ridge of the Western Shoulder. Crossing a gentle snow slope, we came to the site of C3 at 23,500 ft.

Our notorious C3 was located in a covered blue ice crevasse that could hold 3 small tents. With a six foot ceiling and just one tiny entrance hole. C3 earned its reputation as he coldest place on earth.

Above C3 we pushed the route up a 45-degree snow slope for several hundred feet and then traversed across the Western Shoulder to where the 3 mile long West Ridge connects with the Western Shoulder at about 24,000 ft. Stepping onto the Ridge and looking at the summit, still a mile above us, put into perspective the size of Everest. We looked down on almost all of the big peaks we had passed on the way to BC, yet Everest still loomed above.

The one and a half mile ridge that stretches from the Western Shoulder to the base of Everest Summit pyramid is one of the longest high altitude climbs in the world. Once we had safely established our three tents at 25,000 ft for C4, we began the task of ferrying gear across this tremendous ridge. Once carry from C3 would take between 8 and 10 hours of slow, plodding, climbing. In the thin air, climbing without oxygen, we measured our progress in terms of reaching the next anchor point on the rope; we lost all perspective of time.

Above Camp 3 many people hit ""the Wall"" - the physical and mental test that took its toll on all of us. Each of us felt some of the effects of the high altitude, including headaches, insomnia, loss of appetite, lethargy, weight loss and slow healing. People hit their wall at different points. Indeed, just 10 members reached an elevation of 25,000 ft or more and on two occasions severe altitude sickness struck climbers who had to be escorted quickly down the mountain.

As we rotated groups into C3 and above, the Wall took its effect on our climbers and our logistics planning, causing us as much as 50% attrition between C3 and C4. Although Andy Politz and Pete Athans had reached the site for C4 on April 19th, it us over 2 and 1/2 weeks more to reach C5. In addition to the extreme altitude and technical rock, we began to encounter greater problems with the weather as fresh powder snow fell daily, slowing our progress and sapping what little energy we had left.

Despite the increasing odds against us, we slowly pushed ahead, moving supplies and vital oxygen tanks to C4 and pushing the route up the snow field above 4 and into the shattered rock below the Yellow Band. At this point oxygen became the critical supply for further progress.
   
The Summit Bids

As our manpower dwindled and the weather worsened, most of our healthy climbers regrouped at C1 during the first days of May and spent long hours in strategy sessions as the reality of our situation forced us to scale back our original plans for several large summit bids.

On May 3, with hopes high and cameras clicking, we gave a grand send off from C1 to members of our first summit bid. If all went well, found days later Pete Athens, Robert Anderson, Lhakpa and Ang Danu would stand on the summit. The first team stayed that night in C2 and the next day pushed to C4. At C4 the decision was made that sufficient supplies were in place to support only a two-man summit bid. Robert and Pete would try it alone.

On May 5, Robert, Pete, Lhakpa and Ang Danu mad a tremendous carry of materials to the site of C5 - a 30-degree snowfield at about 27,000 ft. After chopping out a narrow platform in the snow and ice, Robert and Pete erected the tiny tent that would protect them from the bitter cold. After two months of hardwork, our team finally had occupied the high camp.

Although they had intended to begin climbing from C5 by headlamps at 1:00 am. problems with a stove and Robert's leaky oxygen regulator delayed their departure until 4:00 am - late for a summit bid on such a difficult route. Above C5, Robert and Pete encountered deep powder snow filling the steep gullies leading into the Yellow Band. By mid-morning at an altitude just under 28,000 ft and facing continued problems with Robert's regulator, they called it day, stashed their spare oxygen bottles, and descended, leaving in place fixed ropes over some of the more difficult spots. Although they had not reached the top, Robert and Pete had blazed the way for our second team, C5 was established, the route into the Yellow Band was fixed, and spare oxygen bottles were cached well above C5. Our hopes now rested with the second summit team.

The radio call that night was lengthy as Robert and Pete informed our second team of what awaited them. Last minute adjustments in logistics were made. If everything went well, on May 9th our second team would try for the top.

Of course, all did not go according to plan. The next day, as the second team moved to C4, two summit climbers were sick and unable to climb above C3, probably because of the suffocating effect suffered the night before, when the entrance to C2 had filled with blowing snow. Attrition had again taken its toll but we still had Jay, Andy, Robert and two Sherpas at C4. Unfortunately, May 8th begain with high winds and driving snow buffeting the entire mountain. Our climbers would have to stay an extra day at 25,000 ft, consuming precious bottles of oxygen. In the midst of the storm, however, Sherpa Fenzo made a miraculous descent to C3 and returned with much needed fuel cannisters to keep our summit hopes alive.

May 9th dawned clear and calm. Jay and Robert, with Andy, Fenzo and Ang Danu climbing in support without oxygen, worked their way to C5. The evening radio call confirmed that Jay and Robert, two of our strongest climbers, were poised for the summit. Everyone on the team knew this was our best, and last, chance to reach our ultimated goal. We all wished them the best of luck.

At 1:00 am on May 10, climbing with headlamps Robert and Jay left what little warmth the tent provided, steped into the bitter, arctic cold and climbed up the steep rock gully that led into the Yellow Band. Shortly after dawn they reached the first team's high point and began the tedious task of switching to the new oxygen bottles stashed there for four days earlier. Jay succeeded, but Robert could not get his valves to function. Eventually Robert took a half full bottle and continued the climb. Several hours later, at an altitude of approx 28,200 ft they stopped to assess their prospects. Looming ahead was the 150 foot vertical cliff of the Grey Step; at least 6 to 8 hours of slow, difficult climbing remained to reach the summit. Unfortunately, Robert had less than 1000 pounds of pressure left in his oxygen bottle - already not enough to reach the summit, much less return.

As Jay recounted: ""We stood there for at least half an hour, just getting colder, and always knowing what our decision had to be."" Without oxygen, a descent on the snow covered, downsloping rocks would be dangerous; a forced bivouac overnight would be inviting severe frostbite or worse. Past expeditions had proven the danger of our route. Both the Yugoslavs and Bulgarians had lost climbers during the treacherous descent from the summit. Jay and Robert weighed the risk and wisely descended.

No one would challenge their decision. We all have considered the ""what ifs,"" but one thing is clear - Everest '85 was not a failure. We had mounted a valiant attempt, but we were exhausted. Our effective manpower at C4 and above was less than half of our team and Sherpas. The deteriorating weather and the prolonged stay at altitude were taking their toll. It was best to leave before we overextended ourselves and left someone on Everest permanently.

On May 15th, with very mixed emotions, we dismantled BC and began the trek towards KTm and civilization. Our ultimate goal had eluded us but we had climbed higher than most of the other teams that had attempted the West Ridge direct. And, we had done so with no fatalities or serious injuries (not even frostbite). We walked out of BC with all our friends. We left with the experience of a lifetime and friendship that hopefully will last throughout our lives. Few people have the opportunity to challenge themselves day after day to their physical and mental limits; Everest had given us that opportunity for over two months.",Climbers knocked down by high winds but no one hurt; no serious frostbites or illnesses,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2451916,

Bonington - 10 May 85

Hoibakk was strongest member of Norwegians; groups went amazingly well at very high altitude carrying same load.

Bass's survival touch and go and Breashears really extended - pushed too fast. Bass's being on mountain only 12 days is surely a record (Messner was at 6500m a long time in 1980). Bass has an exceptional physique: mind and muscle with very positive up beat mind and goes very well at altitude and that combination got him through.


Norwegian Everest press conference - 8 May 85

Naess:
expedition planned in '78
Norwegian members the best they are in Norway
success due to:
- very good planning
- excellent equipment
- very good team
- ""finest Sherpa team that has even been assembled on one expedition and relatively could not have been better
- absolutely excellent LO 
- ""Sungdare is exceptionally strong Sherpa, very intelligent was tremendous feel for mountains.
- when 1st team failed was worried of course about success - one alway is

When Sungdare, Ang Rita and Myrer-Lund fixed rope on Lhotse face they had done important job. Most memorable day: when I was on top, I don't have all that much power to feel it. When I came down to BC to digest it - it takes a few days to realize it everything went so well in every respect, it was a tremendous satisfaction.

Ang Rita climbed entirely without oxygen.
Mrs Schmatz 100-150m above C4 - no doubt it was she
On summit saw 2 prayer flags frozen in snow

Bonington: ""Next one of sadness because so many of my friends have been on summit and contentment.""
 ""no way - once is enough for me."" Will stick to 7000-7500m peaks. ""I found it real hard work."" 

Naess: no accident, no yeti

Pertemba: ""view is much better"" this time - ""quite happy with all my good friends""

Kite-flyer wanted to set a new record - nylon kite - reporter works for Norwegian weekly

Naess: The expense this expedition has born for us is something we take with us - especially relationship with Nepalese people. ""Cleaning Everest is a dilemma - to what extent are you going to clean and to what extent risk lives.""

Bass: ""I feel great Everest  - it's a long way"". Wells telephoned and said he cried for joy when he got news of Bass's success. ""When you got up there you're not thinking much about anything else,"" but did think of Wells and Thapa. ""It brings to a close a chapter of my life, the 7 summits odyssey.""

""Hardest part of climb is above where I got in 1983 - its a big mountain up there"". ""All it takes is one slip, no question of any arrest.

Bass: Threw over into Tibet a postcard a rock from Everest in plastic bag to Marty Hoey who got him into mountaineering. We didn't have the manpower of the party the day before which why took us longer. 4 years in mountaineering scene.

On top was going to thank Creator and dedicate his ascent to all plus 50's in world who share with me that the 2nd half of life can and should be the best as so well expressed in Jennison's Poem ""Ulysses"" (strong in will seek to find, etc.) gotten of the mountain alive

Bass - 7 May 85

""I'm glad to have gotten off the mountain alive."" So slow descending cause oxygen ran out of apparently leaky bottle not long after started down and used David's remaining supply. That too ran out before they reached bottle they had dumped while on their way up. Hadn't been on mountain long enough for thorough acclimatization.


Hillary - 5 May 85

I was thrilled to bits when he got to top - if anyone deserved to get to the top at 200 it was CB because of the many considerable contributions he'd made to Himalayan mountaineering and mountaineering in general.

Must have been a good season, must have been well organized, had good luck with weather and I guess they're a pretty good team.

Dick Bass tremendous drive to get to the top of Everest - getting on the years for climbing Everest and making last desperate attempt - stretched himself to the limit nad was necessary for others pretty remarkable that he persisted.

Pretty remarkable effort for a man of his years and with no real mountaineering background to reach the top.

I doubt I have been capable of climbing Everest at 55! - also would not have had 2 energetic assistants to help me up - whose job it was to get Bass to the top after more than 100 people have been up the same route we did, people know virtually every proble they will meet, though it still pretty hard work, its more a matter of routine than it was in the earlier days - but its a long way.


Nors Larsen - 3 May 85

Breashears had to give his oxygen at top to Bass who was feeling very bad. Bass could not walk down, sat and slid down. Did not make movies on top because too tired.

Return to Everest BC 1 May or so. Hope Norwegians finished 7-10 May so can go to Kala Pattar or even C2 for visit. Then in summit push hope to go up from BC quickly. BC to C2 in 1 day, spend 1 day C2, C2 to C4 1 day, top next day weather permitting including on trekking peaks.

Will established own C2 but use Norwegians C3 and C4. Like to be on top by 15-20 May. Depending on Norwegians and to be present at his 35th Yale reunion on 30 May - 2 June. Will come back to Everest again if doesn't get to top this time.


Ang Rita's use of Oxygen - Spring 1985:

Ang Rita and the American David Breashears were together on the Norwegian expedition led by Arne Naess: Ang Rita went to the top on 29 April, and Breashears the next day. In a letter to me dated 2 July, Breashears wrote, ""During my ascent of Everest in 1985 with the Norwegian Expedition, I was once again on the South Col with Ang Rita, although we did not share a tent this time (as they had before summiting on 7 May, 1983). I visited his tent several times to speak with him and his tentmate, Stein Aasheim. Both Stein and Ang Rita used oxygen for sleeping before and after the ascent. As on his ascent in 1983, Ang Rita spent the summit day without the use of supplemental oxygen.

""Please keep in mind that I present these facts to you for the purpose of keeping the record straight. I don't believe that Ang Rita would deny the above (which he has done several times since 1987), or that it matters to him. I can't think of a stronger climbing companion or a Sherpa for whom I have more respect than Ang Rita, and he did climb Everest in 1984 with the Czech expedition without any use of oxygen whatsoever.""

On 17 October, 1988, Breashears told me that in 1985 again Ang Rita slept on oxygen, but he found the oxygen equipment too heavy to carry and so did not climb with it.",Unoccupied tents at C3 and again at C2 blown away,,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2451897,

Pilon and Rebreyend had to go home on 3 Jan for jobs. Grassi home sick and left with Pilon and Rebreyend. Machado got frostbitten feet and Vagne went home with him. Callande not a climber, but went to C3 and stayed till end. Francou left BC 5 Jan for his work. Ratel left BC 22 Jan. Paul very sick (altitude) and left BC 24 Nov.

Dossin is making plans to return to Everest's West Ridge next winter. 

Abiding by their life-saving instinct, took the decision to turn back. Having to abandon all hope of successfully climbing the last stage, a steep rocky ascent, they had no choice but to dismantle their C4 which had been pitched at 7500m (24,600 ft). Weather conditions were extremely unfavorable (constant strong wind and snow blizzards). Under these conditions any fresh attempt would have turned in ""suicide.""

Between KTM 5 or 6 days from 29 Jan.


Korean Everest expedition - 19 Jan 85

Only 3 French climbers left: Dossin, Chamoux and 23-year-old [Fine?] plus 6 Sherpas left. Italians said W Ridge dangerous, so Nam stayed 8 days at BC and asked permit to climb with French and climbed to 7000m on French route. Then got letter from Oh saying come down (Ministry refused permit because Koreans abandoned attempt). In one month French did not make C4 from C3. They did not bring high altitude food from France, but bought all food in Namche. Also only 3 climbing members left (plus young doctor and leader's wife and cameraman's wife who not climbing). Cameraman went back to French with frostbite and older doctor with him.

Oh went to Korea for funds for more food, tents and Sherpas but by time he returned to KTM yesterday (with less money than needed), not enough time left to return to mountain. Meeting of 9 remaining members decided to abandon climb. See notes of 19 Jan 1985. Nam's strength not so great this winter: didn't have time to get into condition beforehand.

Two human bodies were seen near S Col, one of these was blown to near C2.


Nam - 19 Jan 1985

Reached C4 site 7850m (Kato camp) Nam and Lin and 5 Sherpas on 19 and 20 Dec. Deposited 8 oxygen and tent and food but did not sleep there. Then 3 days in C3 for summit attack but very strong wind 21-23 Dec and on 23 Dec to C2. 2 Sherpas gave up climb and descended to BC: strong Sherpas but afraid of wind. After left C3 wind broke 1 tent. Nam and Lim and 3 Sherpas and 1 cook stayed C2.

24 Dec Nam close to BC. Very strong wind that day and all that night those still in C2 holding down tents which wind broke and then to BC on 20 Dec. 25th Dec 2 Nam and 2 Sherpas in C1. 26 Dec all in BC and decided go down to Namche for tents and food. Tried to go to C3 again to deposit food and bring down broken tents and excess oxygen. 4 Sherpas to C3 and Nam and 3 Sherpas to C2 on 28 Dec. 31 Dec again all down. Tents and food and gas now in C1, C2 and C3, C4. No C5 planned.

Nam in BC till 8 Jan when came to Lukla to meet members there on return from KTM and so to KTM. Leader gone to Korea to get more funds. 

Now have short time: Icefall's broken now. 30 ladders in BC and need 4-5 days to make Icefall route. Arrived Jan in BC, leaves only 15 days. ""I think is very difficult"" to complete climb but ""I want to go home"". Have permit for W Ridge in autumn 1985 and ""I want to rest."" Leader arrived KTM 22-23 Jan and then is too late but Nam waits for him in KTM to decide to go up or go home.

Deputy leader Jeong left expedition because vacation ended. 3 other members also left for Korea on 12 Jan because no longer needed: Jang, Kim and Lee. All remaining members now in KTM except Oh in Korea.

When climbing Lhotse face saw 2 dead bodies from distance under South Col. Very strong wind on 14 Dec and one body blown to near C2 through the air; body and tent and rope and old blue sleeping bag: small boots on feet indicating Sherpa and woman. Koreans planned to bring down body at expedition's end. Could see one other body still high up.

Nam climbed a little with French during his 8 days ""in BC"" waiting for permit to go with them; he reached 7000m in early Jan.


Shrestha, Tourism - 9 Jan 1985

Leader Oh and Chung Sung-Hun arrived KTM yesterday for further assembly of foods especially high altitude food. Left BC 3 Jan. Oh ordered all other Koreans to return to KTM for maintaining good physical condition and are on the way. 3 arrived today. 5 Sherpas staying in BC and others sent to village homes. Intend to resume climb. 20 Jan leave KTM.

Lim Byung-Gil, Nam and 2 Sherpas reached highest altitude 7850m 20 Dec and had to retreat because of strong wind.

Really going strong when all 6 left C3 on 8 Oct for top via C4 biv. On 9th Mackenzie did not join final push so it was 5 for summit. Then winds convinced Nottle and Muir to turn back at 8140m while From and Logan went onto 8200m and then turned back when saw object falling (in case they could help in rescue). Winds were so strong on ridge from top of couloir and lower on ridge as well don't think would have succeeded unless had gone down to BC after 9 Oct and waited a week.

C3 was snow cave on Nepal side of ridge about half way between American '63 C3W and C4W. Reached ridge by more direct route than Americans (to American route's right). Not technically difficult route till very last bit and if Hillary had whole mountain to choose route on would go again to this one.

Nottle fell about 7:30 am and From one hour later very near same spot. Nottle's body reached on N Face but From's body not seen.


P Hillary - 22 Oct 84

We had a very happy trip up to 9th of Oct. Could not have been better acclimatization of all, compatability of members progress excellent. Reached 8200m by From and Logan on 9th. Were climbing solo: all except Mackenzie who stayed at 7900m C4 because not feeling right and weather made it unlikely that summit would be reached. After 2-1/2 hours Nottle, Muir and Hillary decided winds were too high and therefore bitterly cold, decided that chances of reaching top very small, in fact negligible. Winds higher and higher as morning went on. 3 turned back at 8100m shortly after 6:00 am (started 3:30 am) and were descending to C4 when at about 100 linear meters from C4 at about 7:30 am.  Nottle fell - no one saw him fall. Muir was first, Hillary 2nd and Nottle came whistling past 1500 ft down N Face towards Rongbuk Glacier. Surmise he somehow tripped - moved in such a way he fell. Hillary went to body at 25,000 ft altitude. Once I found my friend was dead I came back up again. A dangerous slope that would avalanche in next 2-3 days and he would become part of the glacier.

From and Logan at 8200m saw something moving down and something therefore wrong and descended. Within 20-30m of where Nottle fell, From fell. A sirdar[?] spot - Logan saw the fall: saw him trip and all saw him fall. Don't know where fell too but presume all way to glacier.

Logan said it looked like he stood on hard compact snow disk 3 ft across and it slid out on top of rock and his feet came out from under him and he fell very very fast. Stopped their ascent because saw what appeared to be somebody falling. Was very very cold and sometimes windy. If had gone on up it was a gamble whether would have reached top.

Hillary ""I'll decide at same appropriate stage"" regarding more climbing. ""At present just thinking of going home."" 

Excellent relations with all others on Everest. 

""I don't really like regulations regulating climbing."" Regulating breeds more which breeds more problems. I come from a country where I can go to Mt. Cook and don't have to cook anyone.

Hillary and Mackenzie's avalanche 29 Sept at about 100m distance from C3 at 7400m 30-40 ft slabs of hardened snow on ridge line heading for the Rongbuk. Had gone out to assess snow conditions and so returned to BC a week and started up on 5th Oct. Roddy had to jump off sideways but Hillary skating and scrabbling for hold.

""Many parts of climbing Everest technical difficulty not that great."" Slope when accident occured 35-40 degree which is not technically demanding. ""A slight lapse in concentration which you cannot afford.""

""Have not considered guilty climbing."" My outdoor activities will change but ""I'm sure I'll always go to this mountain.""

""Brilliant effort"": Australians success. Could see same people but not sure who they were, US or Australians. Saw some moving up NE Ridge on 8th. May have had problems with ridge that we were having. ""I personally don't give much credence to yeti but if there's a good story lets hear it."" 

Have permit for Kangchenjunga in '86, but I'll decide in due course what to do about it.

2 members Hillary and Mackenzie had narrow escape with avalanche which checking route above C3. Both climbers jumped to safety. W Ridge route is unsafe and they are waiting for wind change to clear slab from route.

Report from Australians radio report today from BC - doesn't say when it happened.


Letter from Yogendra - 21 Sept 84 

Apart from 3 of us having respiratory illnesses all goes well  here. Roddy has returned for C2 and Kim to return tomorrow. The other three propose to establish our C3 snow cave today at 7400m on the West Ridge. The weather has been reasonably good this season, so far.

We have not had any trouble with the police and this have enjoyed use of the icefall route throughout the Duch icefall controversy. However Basecamp is hardly ""one big happy family"" despite the icefall situation being resolved.

At present progress the Dutch should summit within the next 2 weeks, we could also but move likely over the next 3 weeks and the Slovaks are moving rapidly up the base of the South Pillar. They are a very experienced and mature team. The US groups have their C1 and C2 well established and have gone trekking until the Dutch have completed their climb.


Letter from Yogendra - 17 Sept 1984

Its 2:30 am and I leave for my 3rd trip up the icefall shortly. We'll stay up on the mountain for the next 2 weeks while we established C1, C2 and C3 at an estimated height of 24,500 ft. Everyone is well.

The politics at BC had been unprecedented in my knowledge. Double side by side, ladders in the icefall due to Dutch Police clash and Dick Bass incident is now openly summit oriented. The Slovaks don't agree amongst themselves what they want to climb - Russian route, Polish route or what so on. The Dutch have until the 5th Oct to climb the mountain before the Dick Bass team will begin its climb. 

Murray, Nicoll and I spent out a week in Khunde before moving or up valley to BC which we reached on the 27th August. Although I had planned to ascend the icefall today, due to the continuing tensions between the Police team and the Dutch we have decided to ""side-line"" for a while as we are not large enough to make easy work of the icefall alone. The Police/US team has established C1, yesterday I think it was and plan to put in C2 during the next few days.

The Dutch are still emphatic that the Police must withdraw by the 15th Sept and now the Police are coming down with ""we want to stay on and climb it.""

Ubbink stayed C4 while other 2 went to C2. On 8 Oct Vos, Mourik and Ganesh Gurung set out for top at 2:00 am; Mourik turned back when oxygen ran out at 8600m; Ganesh stopped at S Summit not wanting to go on and Vos went on to top, left his pack at S Summit so no oxygen from S Summit.

He found nothing and left nothing at the summit, and there has been considerable debate ever since as to whether he actually did reach main summit. (He was in such poor condition when he got down to C2 in the Cwm that he spent 9 Oct on oxygen and intravenous fluids). Another attempt by Timmers and Oefner plus Pertemba Sherpa was scheduled for 11 Oct, but wind tore open their tent at the Col camp during the night of 10-11 Oct and they had to descend instead.

Shrestha, Tourism - 11 Sept 84

Tourism Ministry have sent to police here text of Dutch LO and asked whether they have comments regarding report from Dutch Everest expedition's LO revealed by ministry yesterday.


Shrestha, Tourism - 10 Sept 84

Dutch Everest LO report:

31 Aug BC 5350m
Police team set up C2 by 31 Aug
LO of Dutch received message from mountain that Dutch team would not be permitted to use route to C2 made by police. Since alternative route very dangerous until today, Dutch have not been able to climb.

Sept 5 Dutch LO, Plugge and Inspector Thapa discussed situation and 
following understanding:
1) from BC to C2 Dutch can use police made route
2) C2 to South Col route to be made by Dutch which police can use after Oct 4
3) route BC to C2 to be maintained by both teams 
4) before 4 Oct police cannot go above C2 but after 4 Oct police can go above
   C2 to South Col and above
5) Dutch will inform police about condition of route and campsites if police 
   request Dutch will leave fixed ropes to South Col
6) American members with police will be considered members of police expedition 
   at all times and Americans will be considered bound by this agent
7) After Dutch established C3, police can go there twice a week for 
   acclimatization but cannot sleep in camp overnight. Police can put their 
   tents next to Dutch tents to store equipment.

Dutch LO asks ministry for instructions regarding this agent. Will ask police to explain police failure to comply as they have been instructed to cooperate with Dutch at all times and should not impose conditions.

So far ministry stands by the permission to police team to be down at BC on or before 15 Sept and ministry will ask police how they are making conditions about their own climbing after 15 Sept.


Autumn 1984 ascent of Everest by Bart Vos disputed:

I met the Dutch expedition's climbing leader Henri (Han) Timmers in Kathmandu on 20 October, 1984, after they had returned from their climb. He told me that Vos, Miss Mourik and Ganesh Gurung set out from their Camp 4 at the South Col for the summit at 2:00 am on the 8th of October; Mourik turned back when her oxygen ran out at 8600m, Ganesh stopped at the South Summit not wanting to go on, and Vos went on to the top. Vos had left his pack at the South Summit, so he had no oxgyen from there on up. It took him 1:25 hours from South Summit to main summit, where at 4:30 pm he found nothing and left nothing. He was back in Camp 4 at 8:00 pm and Camp 2 the next day, which he spent on oxygen and intravenous fluids. The expeditions that year published a book which stated Vos reached the top alone; the chapter on the summit was written by Vos.

But soon stories emerged contradicting Vos's summit success, and a lively debate sprang up in the Netherlands -- it has continued ever since, with some Dutch climbers who say they know Vos well declaring he would not claim success if he had not reached the summit, and other expressing doubts about his success. I have talked with Dutch mountaineers in Kathmandu about this dispute over the years, and with other knowledgeable people as follows:

- American climber David Breashears, who was on the mountain at the same time, told me in Febuary 1985 he was on the same flight from KTM to Bangkok in October as members of the Dutch team and Mourik said that when Vos got back to the South Col camp, he told her he had not made it to the top, and she felt he had returned to the Col too soon after she had left him for him to have been able to get to the summit. Vos, Breashears said, was not a strong climber. Breashears would leave Camp 2 a couple of hours after Vos and still catch up with him. For him to take off his oxygen set at the South Summit and still be able to continue at a normal rate is ""impossible."" On the Kathmandu/Bangkok flight Vos said he thought he had gotten to the top, but could he have been somewhere else? Timmers said on the flight that, on evidence, he did not believe Vos reached the summit. Ang Rita Sherpa was convinced Vos did not.

- The leader, Ronald Naar, and a member of a Dutch Kangchungtse team, who said in October 1985 that a journalist friend had interviewed Vos and other team members intensively and could not determine whether he had reached the summit or not; he was not convinced either way. Vos, they said, was a ""very confused personality,"" divorced after the Everest climb, his personal life in confusion; he gives conflicting accounts of his ascent.

- Ronald Naar came back to lead another Dutch Everest expedition and told me in May 1992 that Vos's claim to have been seen by Ganesh Gurung from the South Summit when Vos was on the Main Summit could not have been true because the Main Summit is not visible from the South Summit. Ganesh told Naar in 1986 and 1988 that he saw Vos reach the bottom of the Hillary Step and then turn back without have gone any higher.

- An ex-president of the Royal Dutch Alpine Club, Mr. Schreve, said to me in January 1992 he personally thought Vos to have been very near the summit, above the Hillary Step perhaps, but not to the top itself. (He pointed out that all members of the 1984 expedition had signed a statement that they believed he did get to the summit).

- Ms. Mariska Mourik was a member of the 1984 team and was with Vos in the final assault party on 8 October. She wrote me a letter on 24 Nov, 1999 about her knowledge of Vos's incorrect claims to have summited both Everest and, in 1996, Dhaulagiri I. She says:

   ""I do not wish to harm him, but, on the other hand, I find the truth should be known. To me it has to do with the ethics of mountain climbing, and also, especially this past decade, with the crazy drive to go beyond oneself to find the sponsors to be able to climb these expensive mountains.... In mountain climbing not everyone is truthful. They need the summit to get sponsors for their next climb, and they need the attention from the media to get the sponsors. Or they get addicted to being famous. Or they really start believing their own imagined ascents...""

   ""I know incontestably that Bart never made it to the summit of Mt. Everest because I was with him and Ganesh Gurung that day. Around 2:00 pm my oxygen canister was empty (I had only received one bottle, Bart and Ganesh both had two). I tried to go on without, but as I was filming while Bart and Ganesh floundered in navel-deep snow, I was overcome by an enormous urge to close my eyes and have a nap. I wasn't tired physically, the sleep was in my head -- lack of oxygen. It was late, and all three of us knew that it was impossible to reach the summit that day, so I decided to turn around, approximately 50 meters below the South Summit.""

   ""Bart told me that he wanted to try to at least reach the south summit. It took him and Ganesh about another five quarters of an hour to get there (they were there at 3:15 pm). That was the end point. Bart made all the sponsor photos (flags) on the South Summit, and also buried an aluminium box with the names of all individual Dutch $5-sponsors on microfilm in the snow. On the way back down Bart radioed to Herman Plugge in Camp 2 that he and Ganesh had not gone further than the South Summit and that he was on his way back down. This was around 4:30 pm. He gave this exact position: 200 meters below South Summit, where the trace of our first summit three days earlier ended.""

   ""Ganesh was back in Camp 4 on the South Col one hour after I was. He told us Bart was coming down also. When I radioed to Herman Plugge, at around 5:00 pm to tell him that Ganesh and I were back safely and that Bart was coming down, Herman already knew (through the radio contact with Bart) that the summit had not been reached. Bart arrived at Camp 4 less than two hours after me, it was still fully daylight. Bart told me he had not reached the summit. I asked him the question twice, and twice he replied 'No, I didn't make it.' Then suddenly, as if vaguely remembering something, he said 'Yes, I made it.' But he never could have, in so little time.""

   ""When you (E Hawley) came the Summit Hotel (where the team stayed) in Kathmandu, with the story of the Slovakians and Australians and their description of the summit, the things Bart should have seen but never saw, it all concorded with what I already knew. For me there is not a shadow of a doubt. But for most other expedition members it was hard not to believe a fellow climber, and the motor behind the whole expedition: Bart.""

   ""Bart started changing the hours, first in KTM, then at the press conference on our arrival in Holland, shifting them to make it all match (saying we left earlier, and that he reached camp 4 after the summit at 8 pm, which is two hours after dark), but I have all the exact times on the tapes of the radio programs I made that day. Also Bart's description of the summit kept changing. First it was a big plateau 'as big as a soccer field.' Then he reduced it to the size 'of a few carpets.' Implicitly revealed he had never been there. (I have been analyzing all this for my book).""

   ""Of course the wind can erase footsteps, as you write in your fax (to Mourik), but the teddy bear that the Australians left on the summit, was still there, clearly visible, and also the oxygen bottle that was left by an Indian(?) expedition (that the Australians had seen), and the wind that had formed a round wall of snow, and this was twelve days after the Australians had been on the summit. Also, the Slovakians saw no trace of the rope that supposedly helped Bart (without oxygen and without a rucksack) up the Hillary Step, nor of the two ropes he says to have pulled loose. This is all your own information, with which you confronted Herman Plugge in Kathmandu, and once again, it all concords. Even our own Sherpas claimed that Bart never went to the summit.""


Langley, NZ Everest - 7 Nov 84

Gurung, who climbed to South Summit with Bart Vos, says Vos turned back at bottom of Hillary Step. (Gurung angry because had been promised a very expensive sleeping bag from Dutch but did not receive it).


David Breashears - 21 Oct 84

Dutch would never have made Everest climb if Breashears and Neptune hadn't put in route in Icefall. They hadn't enough ladders had little motivation and really not up to such a climb. Doubtful whether Vos actually made summit. Came down delerious (Mrs Schmatz talked to him). May have thought he did when didn't. Should have seen samething on summit but didn't.

Dutch were arrogant, condescending, difficult. No thanks for route. Marched into icefall with banner declaring ""we will climb Everest alone"" or same such words about being alone.


Rodney Korich:

Vos was 3 days at Col on oxygen. Long time to get to South Summit where he abandoned oxygen equipment and camera and everything. Proceeded to hardest part of climb. No new snow after that but no footprints above South Summit. 7 Everest summiters around BC doubt Vos ascent. Dutch were under great pressure to have success.


David Breashears - 3 Feb 85

Breashears was on KTM/BKK flight with members of Dutch Everest autumn 1984 expedition last Oct. Mariska said when Bart Vos got back to South Col camp from summit bid, he said to her he hadn't made it to top and he came back to Col too soon after her th have been on top. 

Bart was not a strong climber. Breashears would leave C2 couple of hours after him and still catch up with him. For him to take off oxygen at South summit and still be able to continue at normal rate is impossible.

On KTM/BKK flight Bart said he though he'd gotten to top but could he have been somewhere else.


Naar and Ms. Lippmann, Makalu II exped - 25 Oct 85

Dutch Everest autumn 1984:

A journalist friend interviewed Bart Vos and other team members intensively and could not determine whether Vos reached summit or not. Not convinced one way or other. Vos a very confused personality. Divorced after Everest climb, personal life in confusion. Gives conflicting accouts of ascent.


Edmond Ofner and all other members of Dutch Makalu Exped:

Bart Vos did reach summit of Everest. The ropes on Hillary Step he said he found were also found by Norwegians next spring. When he returned to South Col he was too exhausted to report. Ofner knows him and is sure Vos would not claim success he had not had: he would not be able to live with himself if he made false claim.


Ganesh Gurung - May 1986

During a trek across Sherpani Col in May 1986, Ganesh Gurung told Richard Salisbury that he (Ganesh) had summited instead of Bart Vos and that Vos had stopped at the South Summit. Ganesh credited Vos with the success at the time because Vos was his client and he felt obliged to do so.

[See also route notes for KANC-853-01 where Ganesh Gurung makes similar claim to 1985 Spanish Kangchenjunga Central expedition].


Schreve, ex-president Royal Dutch - 3 Jan 92

Schreve personally thinks Vos got to very near Everest summit, above Hillary Step perhaps, but not to top itself. All members of 1984 Everest expedition have signed statement that they believe he did reach summit.


Ronald Naar, Dutch Everest Exped leader - 20 May 92

Vos's claim to have been seen by Ganesh Gurung from South Summit when Vos was on main summit could not be true because main summit is not visable from South Summit. Ganesh told Naar in 1986 and in 1988 that he saw Vos reach bottom of Hillary Step and then turn back without having gone higher.


In March 2000, Vos brought legal proceedings against a Dutch newspaper, Algemeen Daqlbad, for an article it had just published written by Ms. Milja de Zwart, a Dutch journalist who had recently been investigating the credibility of Vos's climbing claims, in which she concluded he had not summited Everest and Dhaulagiri I. In April, the judge hearing his case ruled against Vos: ""We will not sustain the demand to rectify because the indications Bart Vos didn't reach the summits (Dhaulagiri and Everest) are this strong, that it is not improper to disbelieve Bart Vos in public.

""We refer to the fact that Vos changed his formerly firm claims on important subjects, such as dates, and in the end doesn't give a sound explanation of his activities and whereabouts during the climbs of Everest 1984 and Dhaulagiri 1996. Doing so, he admits he gave false statements at the time.

""Everything considered, at this stage we think it very plausible on the ground of these investigations, the Algemeen Daqlbad could fairly conclude that Bart Vos's story doesn't fit. There are many contradictions, which hardly could be explained, except by assuming vos didn't reach the summits.""

Vos had the right to appeal this decision until 20 April, but did not do so, according to a fax to me from Milja de Zwart on July 19, 2000.


From the respected daily newspaper 'Algemeen Dagblad' on March 10 [2003]

Mountain climber Bart Vos had accidently proved in a court case, which was meant to clean his image, that he never reached the Summit of Mount Everest (8848m). A tape brought in as proof contained a passage in which Vos explains to expedition leader Herman Plugge that he did not make it to the summit.

The recording was made shortly after Vos abandoned his final climb, on 8th October 1984 at around the five o'clock in the afternoon.

A few hours later Vos claimed via the walkie-talkie that he had reached as first Dutchman the top of the highest mountain in the world.

The tape was played during a court case, filed by Bart Vos, against his former expedition companion Mariska Mourik. She wrote a book, three years ago, that Vos got stuck on the South Summit, 85 meters lower that the main summit.

On the tape Vos clearly says that he did not reach the main summit. ""We reached the South Summit of Everest and the saddle between the South Summit and the main summit. We climbed that saddle, it collapsed partly. We went back in a hurry because time was running out.

Vos uses the word ""we."" He means himself plus the Sherpa Ganesh Gurung who was with him on the South Summit. Mourik who made a film of the expedition, returned on 8700 meters. Her oxygen was insufficient to climb any further.

The tape recording of the walkie-talkie contact has been lost during many years, but was found shortly before the court case. It was found in the house of Leo Jansen, the former editor in chief of the Tros Nieuws show. This popular radio program had an exclusive contract with the Everest expedition.

Vos's success on Everest was doubted from the very beginning. The climber always said that in fact he'd not planned to go further than the South Summit, but that he found himself light and strong enough to push on, after having put off his rucksack and oxygen bottle on the South Summit. 45 minutes later he reached the summit, according to what he told later. Because he had no camera with him, he was not able to prove his success.


Translation of quote from ""Witboek Everest"", Edward Bekker, 2001
(the lost tape recording mentioned above)

Bart is almost unintelligible during the radio contact at half past six. Noise and hissing make his voice hardly audible. Radio contact is lost all together on several occasions. Total length of the contact is 2.08 minutes.

[noise]

Herman (Camp 2): ""Hello Bart, this is Herman, this is Herman, Camp 2. Bart, how are you? Over.""

Bart (South Ridge, approx 8700m): ""This is Bart for Camp 2. Over.""

Herman: ""This is Herman, this is Herman. Bart, can you read me? Over."" [noise and crackling]

Herman: ""This is Herman, this is Herman. Bart, can you read me? Over."" [noise and crackling]

Herman to Peter: ""We've lost him again, damn-it.""

Bart: ""This is Bart for Camp 2. Over.""

Herman: ""This is Herman, this is Herman. Bart, can you read me? Over."" [noise and crackling]

Bart: ""This is Bart for Camp 2. Over.""

Herman: ""Bart, this is Herman, this is Herman. Over."" [noise and crackling] Herman to Peter: ""Must I push this?""

Bart: ""Herman, I can only hear or understand you [coughing] when I push the squelch-button. I'll tell you what we did in short, therefore. We reached the South Summmit and the saddle [inaudible] the summit and the South Summmit. [hijgen] Eh... When we were at the saddle, it partly collapsed. Eh... Then we went back quickly, because we... time eh... was out [some seconds noise, most likely because Herman pushes the send-button. Peter says: ""OK.""] ... and I [inaudible] distance from Camp 4. And, eh... I'll be moving on now."" [noise and crackling, Peter to Herman: ""You again.""]

Herman: ""Bart, eh... Are you still on the eh... Where are you now? Over."" [noise and cracking]

Bart: ""Herman, I'm the last one. And I'm 45 minutes removed from Camp 4. Over."" [noise and cracking]

Herman: ""OK, well that's jolly good. Are... are all the other ones safely back in Camp 4? Over."" [noise and cracking]

Bart: [inaudible]

Herman: [no noise, no crackling. Herman most likely pushes the send-button, but he doesn't speak.]

Bart: [coughing, noise and cracking]

[no noise or crackling, Peter to Herman: ""If you do that, he hasn't got whatsitcalled""]

Bart: ""Herman, [two coughs] I can't hear you anymore, eh... I'm heading for Camp 4 now. I'll warm up the walkie-talkie once I'm there, and I'll use new batteries to contact you again. Over and out.""

Herman: ""OK. I'm glad to have heard from you."" [noise, Herman to Peter: ""Well, that's...""]

[end of recording]

Finally, after many years of Dutch debating, a court-case has brought all facts to light and Bart Vos lost total credibility.

Just a few excerpts of the final jurisdiction:


Mount Everest 1984

The contact via walky talky on Oct 8, 1984:
NB: Herman is Herman Plugge, expedition leader,

Bart Vos:
""Hermann, I can only hear you [coughing] when I press the squelch button. Therefore I will mention short what we managed to do.

We reached the South Summit of Everest and the saddle between the Summit and the South Summit. [deep breaths] Eh... when we stood on the saddle, it partly collapsed. Eh.. then we decided to return quickly, because time eh... was running out...[]


Dhaulagiri 1995

Bart Vos published the book ""Higher than Dhaulagiri,"" in which he states he summited Dhaulagiri on 17 October 1996.

This cannot be true, because two Russian climbers witnessed that on 17th Oct 1996 they were with Bart Vos on the North-East Ridge of Dhaulagiri. So it is impossible that Bart Vos climbed a route solo in the East Face of Dhaulagiri that same day. The two Russian climbers proved their words with a photograph with automatic time/date notification, showing Bart Vos and themselves on: 17th Oct 1996!!! The Russians further mentioned that Bart Vos never reached higher than an altitude of approximately 7200m.

After 17 Oct 1996 Bart Vos descended to basecamp, not only according to Bart Vos' book ""Higher than Dhaulagiri,"" but also according to another Russian climber and an Austrian climber. 

So the justification by Bart Vos that he got the dates wrong, caused by bad weather and deterioration, and that he did not summit Dhaulagiri on 17 Oct 1996 (as published in his book) but on 20th Oct 1996, does absolutely not stroke with the facts that he was seen in Camp 1 on 18 Oct and between Camp 1 and basecamp on 19th Oct.

As mentioned above, these are just two translated fragments of the court-case in The Netherlands, but these are the most important facts, which made the court decide:
""Bart Vos loses the case completely and is sentenced to pay the total cost of the court-case(..)""


Thursday 29 May 2003
To: His Majesty's Govt
Ministry of Culture, Tourism
From: Frank H. Schreve

As you know, the first Dutch ascent of Mount Everest in 1984 by Bart Vos has been contested from the beginning. Therefore at the arrival of the expedition at KTM  an ad-hoc committee was formed to verify the claim of ascent. It was composed of late Dr. Dolf Noordijk, Mrs Elizabeth Hawley and Frank Schreve as Chairman of the Royal Dutch Alpine Club. Based on interviews with all concerned this committee concluded that there was enough likeliness in the reports that Bart Vos claim was warranted. We concluded then unanimously as ad-hoc committee that Bart Vos could be considered as the first Dutchman to have climbed Mount Everest. We followed the then prevailing rule that a climber's word is trusted unless there was evidence of the contrary.

As living members now of the ad-hoc committee of 1984 we have to inform you that we cannot maintain our original conclusion. We consider it as very unlikely that Bart Vos reached the main Summit of Mount Everest. Evidence which was at the time not available to the ad-hoc committee, made us reach this new conclusion. Specifically a sound tape which was made heard at a recent court trial in the Netherlands, was not at our disposal in 1984. This sound tape relates a discussion between Bart Vos and the expedition leader in which Vos states that he turned back just a little farther than the South Summit.

We submit this conclusion to you as ad-hoc committee (Waarheids Committee) which had as task to verify the facts of the Dutch Everest Expedition 1984. We, therefore, suggest you to reconsider the inscription of the Everest climb of Bart Vos in 1984, as well as the honours awarded to the first Dutch Everest climb.


Letter from Herman D. Plugge, Expedition leader
The Committee of the Royal Dutch Climbing and Mountaineering Club

It appears that Mr. F. H. Schreve in KTM, together with Miss Hawley, have sent a letter to the Nepalese Ministry of Tourism concerning the ascent of the Mount Everest by Bart Vos in 1984. I would like to give my reaction to this.

In the letter emphasis is given to a tape with a walkie-talkie conversations recorded on 8th Oct 1984, the day of the ascent to the summit. This tape, together with the related films, was flown to the Netherlands by KLM for the TROS television/radio immediately the expedition returned to KTM. When shortly afterwards rumours started that Bart Vos had possibly not after all reached the summit, a commission consisting of Dr. J. A. Noordijik, Mr. F. H. Schreve and Miss Hawley carried out an investigation in KTM into these rumours. The commission interviewed all members of the expedition, a number of Tchechs who at the same time were on Mount Everest (on another route), and several Sherpas including Ganesh who had reached South Summit with Bart Vos. The tape was very probably not referred to in these talks, possible because it was hardly considered to be of importance compared to all the personal statements, apart from the fact that the tape was already in the Netherlands.

The Noordjik-Schreve-Hawley commission came at that time to the conclusion that Bart Vos in all probability had reached the summit of the Mount Everest. That now, 19 years later, suggestions are being made that this tape had suddenly surfaced and moreover that it provides the conclusive evidence that Bart Vos didn't reach the summit, is for me that questionable. This tape was never deliberately concealed and it was not lost. We were under the impression that Mariska Mourik had it, but some years ago Leo Jansen - producer with TROS-TV - came across it while cleaning out his old files. After consulting Bart Vos, he sent it to him. After the publication of Mariska Mourik's book ""One meter Everest"" and at the request of several expedition members, the tape - because of the poor sound quality - was analysed by Jaap Vermeer (documentary producer and Dutch Broadcasting Corporation technician) using many filters and other technical equipment and then a transciption made. A debate started over the 2nd conversation on the tape: can the word ""between"" be heard or not. Jaap Vermeer did not include it in his transcription because he could not hear it, but according to some it can be heard. The question remains whether this is relevant or not. Can this one word in a recording of a walkie-talkie conversation under very extreme conditions really be the conclusive evidence that Bart Vos was or was not on the summit of Mount Everest? Moreover, after this 2nd conversation, a 3rd followed (see below). Two years ago this tape was put onto the internet, so that since then anyone interested had two whole years to listen to it.

The 3rd walkie-talkie conversation was probably around 7:30 pm (19:30). Indeed the first words spoken when Bart Vos returned to camp 4 on the South Col were confusing for us. In camp 2 we thought that Bart Vos hadn't reached the summit. After several minutes, when Bart Vos himself came to the phone and somewhat disjointedly told his story, it became clear to us that he really had got to the top. A great achievement considering that Bart Vos had spent three days at 8000m, before making his attempt to the summit and after reaching the ""South Summit,"" had to continue without oxygen and without Sherpa Ganesh. Then, according to Bart Vos, after fighting his way to the summit he returned to the South Summit only to find that Ganesh had left (he had sensible decended to avoid frostbite). That he had to make the further descend alone must have been a severe mental blow to Bart Vos. Inspite of exhaustion, Bart Vos realized he had to continue and must not sit down, which probably would have let to him circuming! With his last strength he just managed to reach the South Col only to collapse in front of the tents. Luckily the expedition members there heard Bart Vos and dragged him into their tent. For the first ten minutes he lay apathetically in the tent, but a substantial dose of oxygen revived him somewhat. Those interested in reading the transcript of the 3rd walkie-talkie conversation (as stated in the paragraph above, the conversation can also be listened to) should look on internet site everest.boekboek.nl, page 116 lines 5-10. The text not always easy to understand - is literally given.

I am well award that a number of aspects are vague and unclear, and in the course of time these have been given more weight as a result of uncertainies around later claims made by Bart Vos (e.g., a solo climb of Dhaulagiri). Even so on the basis of what I went through there at the time and on the factual aspects on and around 8th Oct 1984, I do remain convinced that Bart Vos did indeed reach the summit of Mount Everest.

Apart from that, in correspondence of the last months, it has been repeatedly suggested that I deliberately kept facts hidden and perhaps am still doing so. It is such a serious matter that I would not like to make such accusations against others, yet alone have them made against me.",Avalanche on Lhotse Face did hit Sherpa in it; 2 Sherpas & expedition doctor got edema and never able to go up again,Vos's summit claim has been disputed by Czech team Sherpas,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2451656,

Breashears - 31 Jan 86

Breashears found bodies of Ang Dorje and Yogendra at bottom of Lhotse Face and put them in crevasse. Wrapped Yogendra in tarp, Ang Dorje was in a tent; bodies had fallen down face, found in spring 1985.


Rodney Korich, Bass's BC mgr - 6 Nov 84

Yogendra and Ang Dorje between Col and South Summit at last radio contact 24 Oct in good conditions (no deep snow or severe winds). Next day 2 Sherpas at C4 went up looking for them and saw 2 bodies at point where route steepens above Col at about noon.

26 Oct same 2 Sherpas plus a 3rd who had come up to join them at C4 went up to recover bodies. Reached bodies which were roped together. Appeared they had fallen. Were roped together in bringing bodies down got them onto Lhotse face and bodies entangled in ropes and are hanging there apparently. 2 Sherpas at C4 on 24th including Nawang Yonden. Ang Dorje was determined not to use oxygen but Yogendra did use it and there was plenty at C4. Yogendra had been to C2 several times, total of over a week at C2. Summited Lobuje East with policewomen several times.


Kele, Czech Everest - 3 Nov 84

Last Czechs left BC 21 Oct at 10:30 am. Very cold and very strong north wind from Tibet blowing snow. On 20th had talked with Thapa about weather change and strong wind now blowing but did not advise him not to go up.

Nepal Police Cleaning Expedition:

Started expedition KTM under Yogendra Bahadur Thapa 8 Aug - 19 members. Reached BC 23 Aug and 31 Aug established C1, 9 Sept establish C2 22,425 ft. Engaged in cleaning: collected 500 rubbish loads by 22 Sept. 27 Sept just above BC found skeleton of unknown person who had jocket with photo of King Mahendra, bunch of keys and buttons: might be from 1970. In C1, C2 and C3 9 oxygen cylinders and 533 loads of rubbish down to BC - tin, bottles, ropes, etc.

20 Oct - 14 oxygen cylinders from South Col brought to C2 and 2 loads of rubbish from C2 to BC.

21 Oct - 14 oxygen to South Col from 27,500 ft from Col to C2. 20 oxygen and 30 loads of proper plastic and rags cleared in C2.

During cleaning programme pieces of helicopter, tents, snow bars, ladders, human leg bones suspected to be Phu Dorje who had been buried at BC in 1981.

Meanwhile Thapa and team members helped to rescue Japanese lady Akia Kanazawa from Pheriche and Namacho (were members Lobuje West expedition) on 17 Sept and also bring down to BC Czech members.

24 Oct Thapa and Ang Dorje Sherpa left South Col at 6:00 with the purpose of bringing down body of Mrs Schmatz of 1979 Everest. After reaching 27,000 ft at 9:45 am, other group members had no radio contact.

25 Oct at 11:45 am search group found Thapa and Ang Dorje dead, entangled in ropes.

Thapa, born 28 Oct 1948 in Dang District, entered police service 1973 as assistant subinspector and in 1976 inspector. Climbed Tukuche 1976, Pabil 1978, Karyolung 1982 and attempted others.

Ang Dorje, 35 years old from Namche (Thamo), 2 times Everest summiter.


Czechs LO - 28 Oct 84

Yogendra Thapa arrived BC 19 Oct and started up on 22 Oct. On 19th Ang Dorje was putting tent on South Col. Thapa went to C2 on 22 and Col 23rd and reached 200m above Col. Czechs before departure on 21st advised against attempt to climb because of strong wind.

LO heard what happened in Namche on 25th.


Neptune - 26 Oct 84

Yogendra Thapa killed on Everest going for summit. 24 Oct 9:00 am last radio contact. Bodies located apparently between South Col and South Summit - extremely windy.

Yogendra Thapa left KTM 19 Oct. Had never been above C2 while Americans were around and not after mid-Sept. Helicoptered to BC on 19th. Oxygen would have been used by Yogendra but not by Ang Dorje who also not above C2 (was maintaining Icefall). No real acclimatization.


Bass press conference - 25 Oct 84

No plans for Everest in future. Want to get our gear and get home. ""Everest is kind of a knot in my belly."" By the end of the expedition there was very good cooperation with Dutch.

I was strictly member of police team and had nothing to do with their communications.

I want you to know that ""it was my first real hurt"" charge in Nepal that men from Texas bought out police.

""I would like to climb Everest but I can do it with some other expedition if Ministry of Tourism will let me and at much less expense."" Concerned about long term relations with Nepal for Snowbird and its environment which are important to him and why spent so much money and time on Everest clean-up campaign. Want to teach not only mountain skills but mountain responsibilities at Snowbird center.

I'm proud to have been a part of this"" of clean-up of Everest. ""I have a respectable right to come in and help"" and very hurt by queue-jumping charge. 

""We're going home - were not successful in getting a permit."" Was told by my contact, Yogendra Thapa, that this would be a clean-up to the summit."" Was told would have chance for summit. Yogendra called him in June it was go ahead.

I never read regulations on mountaineering and was unaware of distinction between climbing permit and clean-up permission. ""I couldn't conceive permission of there being a big problem"" about his going to summit.

I'm a sadder but wiser person about permits. ""I hoped to get an opportunity [to go to top] but that was not my main concern."" Press put on me a bum rap.""

Knew 3 weeks ago that no permit for Everest for Bass. Had heard before word ""permit"" but didn't realize distinction between cleaning and climbing permits. Had focused on supplies and logistics; queue-jumping charge not fair when Nepalese police invited Bass. If he had engineered whole clean-up operation as way to get top, then would have been fair. Put $50,000-60,000 in Nepal - some went to Police account.

Would be glad to help Nepal climbing school, mountain museum and NMA if their 1986 Everest expedition is a clean-up campaign. Police said problems with Dutch were due to Americans and that why Bass came to KTM last week to seek own permit.

Ministry did not give permit because not in accordance with regulations. ""Real blame lies with me and my naivete.""

Regarding police Bass effort, see also:
- NZ Everest autumn 1984 file - letters from Peter Hillary from Base Camp.
- US Lhotse autumn 1984 who were were actually expecting to climb on Everest
  [but not to top] after contributing to police clean-up effort.


Bass & Breashears - 22 Oct 84

HMG yesterday turned down request for Everest permit, which Bass sought on grounds of help to police clean-up effort and fact that without his ladders, etc., making Icefall passable, others 3 expeditions could not have done their climbs.

Breashears goes back to Khumbu by helicopter tomorrow (and Neptune may return to KTM in it) and will go to C2 to pack up their gear there. Sherpas will go to Col to bring down expensive camera equipment there which needs no packing up.


David Breashears - 21 Oct 84

Bass trying to get permit to climb Everest until 15 Nov now that all other expeditions are off the mountain. Seeking permit on grounds of all the help they gave other expeditions on Everest by putting in Icefall route, most difficult section of whole South Col route.


Dutch Everest - 20 Oct 84

Dutch were stopped from going again in Icefall 3 Sept by police (but their Sherpas were permitted to continue using Icefall route). Americans were at BC then.

Agreement reached 8 Sept: terms as reported by Dutch LO except that police not to go above C3 except carries - not to go above C2 till 4 Oct.

Bass, Breashears and Neptune left BC on 16 Sept for Gokyo trek and returned to BC BC 26 Sept and went above BC to C2 and their Sherpas went to C3 and C4. Breashears to C3 on 4 Oct, then radio message from KTM brought them down finally as Dutch were leaving.


Shrestha, Tourism - 5 Oct 84

Nepal Police:

Ministry of Tourism has granted permit to NPMAF to clean Everest made following conditions:

1) allowed to clean normal route after Dutch have finished.
2) foreign members attached to this team as photographers are not allowed to go to summit but police are; if try for top will be penalized.

SP's letter to M of T says agree Americans will not go above Col. Yogendra Thapa is in BC with his team yesterday - team 45 police.


Harald Knutson - 23 Aug 84

Rain snow every day. Very soft snow in icefall and post-holing to C2. Knutson, Dave and Gary put in route through Icefall with Sherpas after Island Peak when Dutch arrived in force about 5 Sept.

Dispute broke out again. They wanted to use our Icefall route but not to have us on mountain after 15th. Police didn't want Dutch and Americans to talk together and Yogendra stayed at Lobuje BC. American not allowed to go above C1 and police not strong enough to carry full loads and therefore Dutch claimed Police expedition a farce. Police angry stood in force at beginning of Icefall to prevent Dutch going into Icefall.

On one day Dutch made bit of a job to make our route in Icefall parallel to Police route. Then went to Pheriche for more negotiations with Yogendra about 10 Sept. Pertemba, Plugge and Yogendra made agreement as per Dutch LO.

Still at Lobuje BC when Knutson left 7 days ago. Dutch have Bass on tape saying he is on Everest to help clean-up, but must admit if he gets to Col and it's in a sunny day, he might stroll to summit as Peter Hackett did.

C3 at 7300m on SW Face
C4 at 8050m on right side of Pillar
C5 at 8300m on right side of Pillar on snow and rock (1 tent).

Decided at BC to change route: too late for trying SW Face and had only 12 bottles of oxygen (had expected to use 34 bottles left by Soviets on face but bottles not there), so time and oxygen not enough for difficult face climb. No technical problems with Pillar route. In descent used normal route and saw a tent on Col from South Summit in descent (and also on way up), but when reached Col could not find it. Descended together to about 100m below South Summit where Psotka told Demjan to go to Col and prepare tent while Psotka and Ang Rita move slowly (this account continued in attached notes of 31 Oct 84).

Orolin had blood clot in groin while in C3 late Sept; stayed at BC rest of climb. Psotka died in fall on 15/16 Oct.

Bass party helped get Orolin down mountain. Jozef Psotka might be alive if Nepalese-Bass camps in place on Col and Lhotse Face.


Kele - 31 Oct 1984

Last walkie-talkie radio contact at 4:30 am at 100m below South Summit. Demjan left other 2 at 5 pm and arrived South Col 6:00 pm in very good mental condition, found no tent and went to C3 but again could not find tent in dark (had given head lamp to Ang Rita). Arrive C2 1:00 am next day.

Psotka and Ang Rita arrived at Col 11:00 pm midnight. Psotka so tired they dug snow cave. AR then to C3 (which he found) to prepare drink but no cooker and no sleeping bag. After 1-2 hours there felt bad and could not go back up to help Psotka so went down: 8:00 am reached C2.

16 Oct 3 Sherpas including Ang Dorje from police C2 to C3 and wanted to go above but not strong enough go much above C3 and 2 Czechs from BC to C2. One Czech just in C5 pillar 15th night and on 17th Oct went over to normal route and traced Psotka footprints to Col but no trace of Psotka and cave (did find tent at Col). Just met 3 police Sherpas at C3 on 17th and on down. Found body in Cwm at 1:00 pm at bottom of Lhotse face. Psotka must have fallen 1200m down from traverse on face to C3.

Then no more attempts for top. Used strongest men in 2nd summit party for search.

Fiala finished leadership when route changed from SW Face whichhe was prepared for and became regular member. No climbing leader after that. Reached site of C5 and made fixed rope to there.


Kele - 3 Nov 1984

Czech expedition's summiters found on top oxygen blue US bottle sticking out of snow; small figure of bear on top also.

Czechs saw footprints from N Face to top and from South Col to South Summit but not to main summit. No fixed ropes above Col. Vos said used 2 ropes at Hillary Step.


Kele - 3 Nov 1984

Czechs had good relations with all the other Everest expeditions this autumn but could not really understand why Dutch felt so strongly about not having others on their route.

Dutch even raised question about how close Czech route would be to Dutch. Dutch had helped Czechs get permit by agreeing to let them use Icefall but their stand against police-Bass team meant that there were no proper camps on South Col route, even Czech summiters came down that way. Perhaps Psotka would be alive if police-American camps had been there at Col and on Lhotse face.

Americans had provided important equipment for Icefall route to Czechs, Hillary team and Dutch so many ladders, for example. Americans helped Czechs get Orolin down when he was struck by blood clot - very important help.


Shrestha, Tourism - 5 Oct 1984

3 members and 2 Sherpas established C4 at 7780m on 2 Oct and saved day the 2 Sherpas went to C2 leaving 3 Czechs at C4 intend to establish C5 by 13 Oct.

9th May was 1st attempt; three set out from C5 at 6:45 am (Phu Dorjee, Ang Dorje and Rita Gombu) and Ang Dorje and Rita Gombu reached 100m below South Summit when at about 8:00 am. Ang Dorje's feet very cold and he feared frostbite. Phu Dorjee was 100 ft above them in high winds (70-80 km). Rita Gombu decided to turn back in winds. Phu Dorjee on top at 12:30 pm (without oxygen from last 200m only). All slept on Col that night. Phu Dorjee overtook Bulgarians at about 10:15 am and Indians put up 1st Bulgarians team at Col camp and brought Metodi Savov to C2, etc, spending 2 days Indian manpower resources.

2nd attempt was Nima Dorje (ND) Sherpa's party at col for May 9th attempt, but Bachendri Pal got to Col late and Bulgarians needed help, so Khullar called it off. 

3rd attempt by Palzor, Lathoo, Rekha Sharma and Rattan Singh, latter fearing frostbite turned back, winds prevented on early start 16 May and avalanche of 15/16 May hit 4th summit party and required rescue. 4th party was ND Sherpa, Lobsang Tshering and Bachendri Pal. 

5th party went to top from Col. Its final membership was determined at Col and were the 4 summiters of 23 May.

1 Sherpa killed by avalanche in Icefall from Lho La on 26 March and cremated. Rai kitchen boy died of altitude sickness on 28 March while only one advance party man was at BC and he descending to Lobuje alone.

Avalanche ice blocks of 15/16 May midnight buried C3 and of 3 members and 7 Sherpas, 3 Sherpas seriously injured (Bachendri was there). Rekha Sharma fell in crevasse in Icefall but 3 days later was back in C1. No frostbite at all.


Khullar - 5 June 1984

Three bodies seen by Everest expedition on the mountain: 

1) At bottom of SW Face: upper torso bare skin and bone, dark brown hair perhaps shoulder length or shorter - definitely that of a woman. C2 cook Ang Tshering said he removed wrist watch. Khullar buried remains under pile of stones.

2) On SW Face at about 22,000 ft, 200 ft above bergschrund spread-eagled body, flat on face, red jacket, black hair - rather prominently visable.

3) On face between S Pillar and SE Ridge at about 28,000 ft (just above Indians C5). Tall figure apparently recent victim - easily seen.


Sarin - 2 June 1984 (press conference)

Bachendri Pal is first single woman to top of Everest
Ang Dorje is first man to go to top with woman twice
Rita Gombu reached 100m short of South Summit
Phu Dorjee started without oxygen 100m below South Summit, rare to carry on 
  top when oxygen stops.
Palzor without oxygen from top throughout descent
No member had any experience of Nepal mountains

Bachendri Pal:

Took to summit start of Durga and Indian Flag. Left statue there after prayers and flag on it brought ice (now water) and stone from summit.

Lhatoo and Ang Dorje found top of Chinese tripod. Lhatoo found pouch containing a photo of man with inscriptions. 

Khullar:

Near C2 body found with little skin, long dark hair, no clothing, at 21,800 ft. Another body 27,000 ft, 100m below South Summit, blue jacket.

Was slower than others when carrying 2 oxygen bottles. Dumped one and caught up then had another problem - descended with the others.

Had prayed for a year for Everest and will continue to do so ""as Buddhist considers highest peak sacred."" Was inspired by fellow Ladakhi who went to top in 1965.

6 am made 3 attempts to go top that did not succeed. One was in C3 when avalanche struck. 1st attempt was on 5 May. Logistics prevented more successes after the two. 

Expedition not ready to recon thru Icefall until 5-6 April after avalanche. 10 days delay by avalanche of March 26th. All of May was good weather and 23 May was best of all.

4 women reached South Col - this a record.

Rekha Sharma's party called down from Col, thus being prevented from going to top because support below diverted to evacuation of Sherpa with broken leg from C3 after avalanche struck, winds were preventing them to go up after 1st night at Col and should not stay longer.


Rekha Sharma - 2 June 1984

Khullar was just as weak and unassertive on the climb as he is in KTM. Supply problems were considerable - ""it was just chaos.""


Prachanda Shrestha, Tourism Ministry - 16 May 1984

C3 hit by avalanche 00:35 hours, ND Sherpa and 3 Nepalese Sherpas (no names) hit and seriously injured. Lobsang Tshering and Bachendri Pal escaped unharmed; some other Nepal Sherpas minor injury and shock.

Bulgarian Everest press conference - 24 May 1984

Avramov:

Bad weather in general. Lot of difficult moments and difficult to decide when to mount summit attempt. Grateful for help of Indians on South Col route.

19 April with Chhowang Rinzing and Prodanov arrive C4 and early am, (about 5:45 am) on 20th left C5. After 2 hours together to 8300m according Sherpa, an empty oxygen bottle fell hit Sherpa and caused him to retreat. Prodanov went on up at 11:00 am alone. 6:15 pm he reported he already on summit with 4 empty [?] and flag of USSR expedition. Said he would bring part of flag but ropes broke (found by later summiters at summit). 8mm movie camera left by him on top and this too found by 2nd pair, but film had been taken out by Prodanov. After 33 minutes on top he descended and at 21:10 hours on radio - then he switched it off. 

21st April next day he said had lost gloves and could not use his fingers. He was on radio until 5:30 pm when his voice heard for last time. Assume he died of exhaustion and exposure that evening/night.

Doskov: 

Did not see tripod did not see any bodies including Prodanov - deep snow.

Prodanov spent last hours at place where rucksack and ice axe roped to rock to about 8600m expedition suppose. These seen by both summit pairs. He said he said he had left there behind taking only his ice hammer. Climbed only on ridge - maybe 1 meter on Chinese side but very dangerous and stayed on right side of ridge.

Avramov:

2nd summit group started early am and very slow in climb in deep snow. Very late on top 5:18 pm, so down same route not able to reach C5 and asked Indians if Ok in emergency to use SE Ridge. Next pair did traverse in order to help first pair. Also traversed to search for Prodanov's body as he might have descended SE Ridge in his confusion. 

Difficult to measure cooperation but we tried to help Indians when they needed help: Bulgarians left oxygen bottles and walkie-talkies.


Kalayanov - 24 May 1984

Yankov to 8500m on 21 April at 9:00 pm when was ordered to descend and went to about 8300m where very steep very bad rock and spent night there in sleeping bag for Prodanov - talked to him all night to keep him awake. 22nd weather worse, C4 and C5 tents damaged. Yankov saw rucksack of Prodanov so it must be below 8500m and Yankov brought down ice axe. Yankov used oxygen on 21st and 22nd.

Prodanov left his oxygen mask in BC and never used oxygen. Survived more than 50 hours above 8000m.

8th May summit pair used oxygen. They were on summit 5:15 pm and bivouacked there unprepared for this biv in a crevasse beginning about 8:00 pm.

10 May 1st pair very exhausted (saw man riding bike). Started down and Valtchev met by Phu Dorjee who reported to 2nd pair that a Bulgarian was unconscious. 2nd pair on top they thought at 9:00 am in fog. Then at 100m realized had not been on actual summit and went back up and were on top about 10:15 am. Down SE Ridge and met Phu Dorjee at South Summit, Savov just below South Summit unconscious. Saved his life with oxygen and they roped him in middle and started down. Valtchev moved alone to C4 at 4:00 pm and others at 4:30 pm including Phu Dorjee. 4 Bulgarians and 4 Indian team in C4 that night 10 May. All 4 Bulgarians had been climbing on oxygen.

Djambazov and Dolaptchiev went to Indian C2 8 or 9 May and 11 May went up. Djambazov went to Indian C3 while Dolaptchiev met 3 Bulgarians summiters descending (Valtchev stayed all alone at C4) between C3 and C2. Djambazov on 11th late afternoon went up to meet figure descending from Col and met after dark and other reached C3. Others descending on 11th stayed in Indian C2. All continued descent.

4th summit party of Vasilev and Dermaljiev reached Bulgarian C4 9 May. Dermaljiev snowblind in evening so unable to move. They spent 10th May in C4 and down on 11th May. Then expedition ended.

Valtchev and Savov doubted whether to go up or down. Looked at Hornbein Couloir, found too much snow there and decided to continue up W Ridge. This was about where Russian joined Ridge from SW Face.


Prachanda Shrestha, Tourism Ministry - 10 May 1984

8 May Savov and Valtchev descended from top 17:38 hours. After 2 hours reached South Summit. Could not reach Indian C5 and spent all night at South Summit. Had 2 oxygen bottles and 1 burner - were exhausted.

9th May Savov and Valtchev started down towards South Col early am. Fog thick making descent difficult.

Petkov and Doskov at 3:00 started to summit from W Ridge C5 and 9:11 am they thought they were  at top, in fog and started descending. After little descent fog cleared and realized mistake and started up again and reached true top 10:08 am. Found 8mm camera left by Prodanov. Were told by BC that Savov and Valtchev were in summit area. Started descent of SE Ridge and at 10:45 am met Phu Dorjee at South Summit while Phu Dorjee going up. Meanwhile Savov and Valtchev trying to find way to South Col, moving very slowly because exhaustion and heavy fog. Valtchev lost Savov and saw 2 persons 100m below him (probably Rita Gombu and Ang Dorje) and tried to go to them. Valtchev descending with great difficulty.

Press Release

The Bulgarian Everest 1984 Expedition, consisting of 24 members and led by Avram Avramov (46) completed the second ascent of the West Ridge. The Bulgarians established BC in mid March and quickly placed 5 camps, at 6050m, 6770m, 7170m and 8120m, the last on Aprl 19. On April 20th the strong climber Christo left C5 at 5:45 am for the summit accompanied by Rinzi Sherpa. He turned back after he had been ""hit by a falling oxygen bottle."" Prodanov decided to continue alone without bottled oxygen. It was a hazardous decision - from C5 he had to climb 750m of steep ridge. After a struggle up the ridge, at 6:10 pm, Prodanov reached the top. He was the first man to climb the West Ridge alone and without oxygen and the first person to scale this summit in April as spring ascents have been made in May. Descending Prodanov hit trouble between 8500m and 8300m. Exhausted and deteriorating he spent the night without gear, food, drink and oxygen and lost his gloves. The last BC contact with Prodanov was next day at 6-7:45 pm. ""I see nobody to rescue me,"" he said in his last feeble radio message.

High winds and bad weather prevented efficient rescue efforts. Solo Ludmil Yankov (26) reached 8400m but could not find Prodanov, who may have died on April 21 or 22.

Despite the mishap, the team tried to put more men on the top. On May 1st the second attack began from BC. On May 7th Camp 5 was equipped with food and 11 bottles of oxygen. Next day Metodi Savov (37) and Ivan Valtchev (37) started their summit bid. Deep dry snow slowed the ascent. At 17.15 (5.15 pm) they reached the top. The descent was made via the less difficult SE Ridge. Just below the 8765m South Summit they were exhausted and spent the night without a tent or oxygen, although they had used oxygen, whilst ascending. During the night Savov's toes were frostbitten. Next morning the two climbers became separated in thich fog on the descent.

Meanwhile at 10:10 am the top was reached by two Sofia students - Nikolai Petkov and Kiril Doskov. They also descended the southeast route. They caught up with Savov who was in an exhausted condition 30m below the South Summit and helped him down using oxygen from the Indian expedition. At 13:50 pm they reached the Indian Camp 5 where Valtchev was waiting. They were helped by the Indians at the South Col then continued the descent together, reaching BC in 2 and 1/2 days. On May 12, Savov was airlifted from BC to KTM by helicopter, and on May 13 the party left the region.

The two pairs made the first traverse of the full West Ridge-SE Ridge and the second traverse. Savov and Valtchev survived an open bivouac at some 8600-8700m.

Christo Ivanov Prodanov, meritious sports champion and deputy leader of the Bulgarian Everest Expedition, died on April 21st 1984 after making the first ascent of Everest in April and the West Ridge Ridge without oxygen.

He was born in Karlovo on Feb 24th and graduated in metallurgy. In 24 years he made major ascents in the Caucasus, Alps and Dolomites, including the Petit Dru by the Bonatti Pillar, the Walker Spur, Freney Buttress (1969) and Matterhorn North Face in extremely severe conditions and the Petit Dru by the Guides Rotue (1977).",Prodanov death at 8600m; Yankov frostbitten fingers; 1 member hit by falling empty oxygen bottle in Apr; Savov frostbitten toes,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2451485,

Pasang Temba Sherpa of summit party turned back alone. Slipped at very easy snow field but very tired. Americans saw him fall down Nepalese side but body not found.

Japanese Everest Sangaku Doshikai team actually climbed same route as American autumn 1981 expedition to left of Geneva Spur, right of South Pillar. Not on Polish Pillar route to S Summit, but joined SE Ridge just above Col as did Americans in 1981 autumn. Climbed entirely on snow, no pillar rock.

Japanese Lhotse Expedition

Yeti Dojin Everest expedition member Sawagami used oxygen in C2 on his descent because he was in ""no good condition."" Sure about Sawagami because they helped him and he used Lhotse expedition oxygen.

Endo biv site very dangerous because very cold and very windy. Coming down next day on his legs but on laboriously. Ang Tshering went up met at 8300m and helped him down.

Yashima and Kamura last year biv at 8350m on K2 and very lucky, no wind and in good condition, but lost same fingertips from frostbite. On return to C2 by Endo and may be Sawagami used oxygen on Everest.


Endo - 21 Oct 83

C4 at South Col. Highest 3:00 am on 8 Oct all 4 climbing members left C4 met 2 members and 1 Sherpa of Sangaku Doshikai (SD) team at 8100m at 4:00 am: Endo started first from 8100m followed by SD team Kawamura and Suzuki, Pasang Temba Sherpa, next Kamuro, Yoshino and Sawagami. All 7, next 3 Americans at 8500m and Americans went on up. Sawagami stopped going up when at 8800m because was exhausted and reached C4 same day.

Pasang Temba also reached 8600m and then down because exhausted Americans saw him falling at 8600m and were last to see him alive. Body not found but seen to be falling down SW Face.

Endo at S Summit at 2:00 pm waiting for Yoshino and Kamuro and at that time 2 members went ahead to summit. Yoshino and Kamuro joined him at 2:30 pm and all 3 continued up and all 3 met Americans at Hillary Step. After SD team reached summit, 10 minutes later Endo on top at 4:30 pm and Yoshino and Kamuro 4:50 pm on top. Endo waited at top and then little below while they went to top.

SD two went down first after Endo: they had met on top. Then Yoshino and Kamuro of Yeti Dogin descended. Endo met Yoshino and Kamuro about 50m below summit and 3 down. At South Summit because dark when Endo arrived at about 6:00 pm alone and decided to biv below South Summit and back towards main summit he had seen Yoshino and Kamuro at Hillary Step when almost dark. Expected Yoshino and Kamuro to join him - bivouacked at 6:30 pm. Thinks Yoshino and Kamuro bivouacked just below Hillary Step Endo slept for 8 hours, woke up at 6:00 hours.

9 Oct - 6:00 am Endo began decent from biv site. Saw Yoshino at 6:10 am fastening boots just below Hillary Step and waited near S Summit for Yoshino for 1 hour and then again started down too exhausted to go up in search. Reached C4 that day at noon.

10 Oct Endo at 10:00 am left C4 and reached C2. Thought he would die.
 
11 Oct found Yoshino body by sirdar at 6300m. Must have fallen 2000m down SW Face. Body spotted by crows being overhead. Body identified by SD and brought to C2 (identified by having toes) where put into crevasse. Kamuro's body not found, might be at bottom of SW Face.

Meanwhile established new C1 at Lho La. Had no intention to attempt W Ridge because strong winds in Dec; intended to go to N Col. Sherpas refused W Ridge climb (too cold for so-so Sherpas) and were told to carry loads to pully and sleep at BC, so members were alone at Lho La and beyond.

Metzger - 1 Oct 88

Did not attempt West Ridge. Went from Lho La and from this only 5 hours to North Col (with good acclimatization). Had 1 tent and 1 cave at North Col and stayed there 1 week. Reached 7600m on N Ridge and then saw a tent ahead but very windy on ridge. Metzger slept 4-5 nights at North Col.

7600m reached by Metzger 
7500m reached Batard and Audoubert both times stopped by wind.


Metzger - 14 Jan 83

For Bourgeois to descend to C1 way was not difficult and when Jean said preferred return to C1 at 6000m because had headache - were 4: Ghilini, De Blanchard, Metzger and Bourgeois going to C2 at 7000m. Metzger agreed he should go alone for 1 hours descent. Bourgeois at 10:00 am [on Dec 27] left the other 3 at about 6200-6300m. Metzger watched him descend for 1/2 hour well and so not worried. Reached C2 about 12:30 and had lunch. At 2:00 pm called C1 and friend Pierre Steiner who had come up from BC said Bourgeois not there at C1. So 3 descended immediately to point last seen. Steiner camp up from C1 to place where can see his crampons tracks on hard snow and reached all crevasses there and looked down the side.

That night stayed at C1. No search in moonlight because impossible. Again searched on 31 Dec same area despite bad wind making impossible stand and same next day. 2 Jan went to C2 and brought down all gear to C1.

BC about 5450m. All down finally 4 Jan evening. ""We thought it was possible to go to Tibet but without food and sleeping bag, we thought he was dead.""

Kato - when got down from summit was worst for wind and at C1 was -33 degrees C in evening. I think he was higher and when you slip from this place its not the same thing."" I think they are finished.

Regarding our expedition at first thought to continue climb but then with Bourgeois gone and wind blowing open blanket of C1 icehole every one thought Bourgeois coming back and could not sleep and gave up.

7700m highest point, before Xmas about 21 Dec.


Bourgeois - 14 Jan 83

Said goodbye knowing had cerebral edema because wanted his friends to continue to summit. Metzger had offered to go with him. Headache got worse and worse, had nausea lost balance and fell down. On Nepal side would have been dead but on Tibetan side fell less than 100m distance. Not hurt by fall but shocked (maybe lost consciousness briefly) and having edema. Only 2 solutions: 1) go up to C1 where was oxygen but too exhausted to go up: 2) go lower and lower in direction of Rongbuk glacier, which did, hoping to find monastery where could rest and get food. Spent night amongst rocks on glacier. Next afternoon reached ruined monastery. Now not possible to go back though health improved but balance not good. Left monastery and walked 2nd day and 2nd night. In am of 1 Jan reached village at dawn. There Tibetans gave tea and Tsampa. ""It was a good New Year for this morning."" Continued down same day alone and at night slept in little house in little village where Tibetans gave food (tsampa and food). Morning of 5th day 3rd Jan, reached first town Shigar on East-West road and became chief guest of ag. who gave bed and food. In town they telephoned to Shigatse and next day 4 Jan sent in Japanese to Shigatse where met Chinese officials and shared room with 2 Chinese and was free to walk around town and Tibetan who spoke perfect English as interpreter.

No other accident or frostbite. Kobayashi frostbite not a problem.

They could not have moved against wind and they bivouacked before they became exhausted since oxygen finished and little food (oxygen finished by 9:00 pm radio call). Would have been Ok in am of 28 Dec if no big wind blew them away. Wind blew C2 tent 10m down with Sasaki in it.

Oxygen used from C3 upwards except Kobayashi carried supplies to C4 without oxygen; used oxygen for sleeping in C4.

Icefall avalanche that scared French Everest expedition into changing route was not so big; just little serac collapse.

Kobayashi said Everest normal route easiest climb of 8000er he'd experienced; just wind and cold were obstacles.

Came down to C3 (C4 below Geneva Spur 7900m too windy) arrive C3 3:30 pm after 2 hours on Col looking for same thing but he could not find ""I think night time finished."" very strong wind blowing and I sleeping and my tent in C2 blown out with Sasaki in it.
 
23 Dec 1st attack plan: Kato first try alone, 2nd time Kobayashi also because Kato feel same complaint alone, cannot carry so much baggage and expected biv. Took stove and biv tent and French regulator but not found full oxygen bottles. Kobayashi weaker than Kato so unable go top but reached above South Summit maybe 8800m. Kobayashi had some frostbite but not specified how much and where no further rescue: not enough oxygen, went so fast not fully acclimatized including most Sherpas.

Kato could not stand on top more than few minutes because very strong wind - tripod see? no report.

I very sad about Kato and Kobayashi, when Sasaki went with twice Dhaulagiri I 1978 and Annapurna I 1982 if not strong wind, they back to C4 easy. No snow problem on mountain because so much snow blown away by wind. I think wind from Tibet blow Kato and Kobayashi down SW Face. No search for bodies in later season.

Kato and Kobayashi: At 10:00 am 27 Dec Kato contacted C2 and said reached 8400m and Kobayashi is trailing behind him. At 11:00 am Kato told C2 he was at 8500m. At 1:50 pm he told C2 he was at South Summit 8763m. At 7:50 pm Kato told C2 and C3 Kobayashi could not reach summit but Kato had done so and had returned.

""I met Kobayashi here. I reached the summit and came back to this point. Kobayashi's hands and feet are frostbitten. My health conditions is excellent.""

At 11:00 am said he had seen a body. At 7:50 pm Sasaki's at C2 told Kato he Sasaki will send Nawang Yonden Sherpa to receive them on 28th morning. Kato replied ""our health condition is good. We are comfortable and you should not send him."" At 9:00 am Kato told C2: ""It is very cold now here. I will not contact again tonight, only tomorrow morning, good night."" Since then no contact has been made.

28th Dec Nawang Yonden sent to South Col to see whether Kato and Kobayashi coming down. He could see footsteps at Col but did not see Kato and Kobayashi. At Col between 9:00 and 10:00 am and went to C4 and slept there that night from 28th 10:00 am till 29th evening was hurricane - like wind above C2.

Still no contact with Kato. C4 has highest food and oxygen. When Kato left C2 had oxygen and French oxygen regulater and knew plenty of oxygen bottles above South Col.

At BC today snowing heavily, -15 degrees and wind not strong. Probably cannot see summit. BC no comment regarding death.


Sharma, Tourism

LO: Today's weather bad, no one has gone up today for search. This evening members consulting via walkie-talkie and if weather good tomorrow will go up.

Kato took gas stove from C2, also oxygen. 


Sharma

""I think there is still chance Kato will come down being experience climber and having very good stamina and no shortage of oxygen above South Col. I think he is trying to rescue Kobayashi so that is why he has not come to C4. Rescuing Kobayashi because he had frostbite and his condition worse.

Kato - 23 Nov 82

Sasaki maybe today to Lukla and Kato tomorrow. 
BC established about 28-29 Nov.

Maybe 4 camps above BC. If bad weather maybe C3 at 7500m (bad weather = wind), otherwise C4 at 8100m is above Col to avoid its winds.

Route up Lhotse face = normal route. ""From South Col to summit not so difficult - only walking, but in winter very difficult. If French want normal route my party success first. My party finish then okay hope to climb Everest in Dec this winter.

60% chance of success by this expedition. ""First plan was to climb above. My powers very strong powers and alone is best but intentions very difficult so if weather good and my condition is good maybe I go alone from final camp"" or maybe with others. C3 to top very long way and maybe Kato alone carry 3 oxygen bottles @7.5 Kg.

Uemura was very strong but his team is not strong and Uemuras not climbing alone. This season no success where Kato can succeed.

Sasaki and Seikizaki on K2 on north side as support members, not so strong as Kato, Nakamura and Kobayashi, but strong.

Summit on Xmas = hope.

Plans final push to summit to start at night: if from C3 at 10:00 pm, midnight, if from C4 also at night. No biv: 20-25 hours C3 to top to C3 moving continually and on oxygen. Impossible to sleep in last camp anyway. At night wind not so strong. Have special equipment and clothing for winter including warm helmets that came down low over ears.

Saw no oxygen bottle or anything else on summit which reached just at dust; footprints could have been from last May, eroded by wind which had blown away summer monsoons snow.

Was very helpful having the 2 Nepalese, Lobsang Tenzing and Narayan Shrestha, along. They looked after C1 which was climbing base, knew the foods members liked, and Tenzing was fluent in Tibetan and could get on well with yak drivers (Chinese LO knew little Tibetan and was arrogant towards yak drivers).

South team had to hurry up to catch up with N side climbers because were 10 days late at BC due to transport problems to BC (after 29 March in almost daily walkie-talkie radio contact with north side). No mountaineering problems but communications problems among 3 nationalities who had ""quite different"" ideas especially ""Chinese who had quite a bureaucratic inflexible attitude."" Chinese were CMA staffers or TMA staff members, not army who had to obey orders from North BC or later when contact established by radio with Beijing, orders from Beijing of what they must do - where as most Japanese members paid some fees to join. Nepalese on salary from NMA but were quite familiar to Japanese. Tibetans could not speak frankly to others because ""observers"" were in BC who were Han Chinese and Han Chinese at BC could not differ with Beijing. 

South side climbing not much snow, so had packed ice. Icefall very dry and stable - on summit climb 5 May, deep snow on ridge. 5 May summit group planned to be 2 traversing parties: Top Bahadur Khatri in 2nd group but miscalculated oxygen supply with not enough on South Col: 24 bottles were there Ok but 17 or 18 empty on 4 May when these 6 and 6 support members on Col or above, hoping all to go to top. 2 Chinese were to go so went, Ang Phurba followed them to C5 to 8300m on 4 May - not enough oxygen at 8300m for Kitamura to go with them, so he stayed at C4 and tried to go to top on 5th from C4 early morning in very strong wind. Khatri and Isona and supporting members including Sungdare did not try to go up because oxygen at Col only enough for one summiter from there. Kitamura reached South Summit at 3:00 pm; was told it too late for him to continue, leadership felt, and told Yamada to bring him down.

7 May Beijing said climb finished but young Japanese and some Nepalese climbers did not agree. 6 Nepalese went to South Col: Sungdare, Padam Bahadur Tamang, Ang Karma, Ang Rita (Thami), Narayan Shrestha and Hira Bahadur Rana - why all 6 did not reach summit Isono doesn't know. Nepalese defied end of climb decision and it was their country, but Japanese were not permitted to continue, much to their unhappiness. 
 
South Chinese climbing leader stayed in North Col camp with Shigehiro at end of climbing period.                                                                                                                                       

North side 3 stages of climb: 

1) make camps and carry loads to N Col, 
2) do same to C6 with loads but not occupy higher camps - then all down
   to BC for rest,
3) complete climb 

In 1st stages down to BC when bad weather came after C3 established. In 2nd stage C6 reached but not slept in for 1st time on 9th April. In 3rd stage C6 occupied and rest of climb completed. Did not at any time have to wait for south side climbers to make progress because south side route easier to climb and number of camps less and fact summit date fixed for 5 May.  team led by Yamada who knew south route. 6 Yamada selected before leaving Japan so could descend without south side climbers to guide them down. Oxygen used in C5 sleeping, same members climbing above C5, all members sleeping in C6 and C8 and climbing above C7. From summit Yamada left about 10:30 am with Ang Lhakpa and Cerin Douji. Linert Yamada party at top and left 11:00 am. Lhakpa Sona and Yamoumoto left 12:30 pm. Camera crew reached top just few minutes before south side trio arrived and left at 1:00 pm. 2nd traverse team in C5 ready to go to top (had ferried oxygen and food and fuel to C6 on 6 May) when decision taken late night 6 May by Chinese leader (final decision taken 3:00 am 7 May Chinese time) so 2nd team to N Col 7 May. In 2nd team was Mitani who would have been his 4th ascent.

Japanese climbers very greatly disappointed by decision to call off climb. Assume decision taken to quit before anyone hurt. In each camp to and including C6 3-nations members lived in separate tents and ate own national foods at BC but above had basic Japanese food with Chinese and Nepalese Tsampa or yak meet to their own taste. All load carrying forced to be equal.

A body was found in a tent at 7500m on NE Ridge, north side climbers reported - was Westerner from clothing label, perhaps Spanish - definitely not Mallory.

Isono - 27 Feb 88

Chinese 1960 and 1975: 500 members including 200 soldiers for party from BC - ABC (5000-6500m) and including BC staff doctors and communicators and journalists - climbing 150 total but above North Col 70 climbers only, 35 above 7600m - both years were military exercises: sports committees for military fitness.

1988 first time Chinese have chance to join another type of expedition, one organized purely for mountaineering. Most Japanese members are amateur and all paid to be on this expedition half or finances from or collected by members.

Chinese govt pays its members salaries and BC food and equipment and getting all to BC.

3 team leaders at each BC and climbing leader; 3 general leaders in Birjunj - these leaders must respect decison of climbing leaders.

Political problems can arise: climbing leaders feel weather conditions to bad for safe climbing and want to withdraw from mountain but general leaders in Beijing want climb to keep going. Isano hopes general leaders will listen to climbing leaders.


North side

3 stages of climb: 1st stage all baggage to ABC; 2nd made route to C3, C4 and C6 and then all members down to BC for rest 7-10 days (had originally planned to go down further then BC, to Xixabangma and Xegar but not enough time). From mid-March to mid-April, much strong wind and had to crawl above N col. After mid-April wind lessened. First summit team left ABC 30 Apr to C4, 4 May from C6 to C7 and slept there, 5 May to summit and down to S Col; stayed 2 hours on summit (9:25-11:30 am NST). Li Zhixin, support member carried oxygen only for himself but should have brought supply for summit-traverse party. Cerni Doji oxygen finished on summit and Yamada's at bottom of Hillary Step. Li was only other climber from North be on top while traverse team from N were there. Yanada and 2 met Da Cering, Ang Phurba and then Rinzen Pungcog at bottom of Hillary Step; Ang Lhakpa gave his new bottle of oxygen to Ang Phurba here because Ang Phurba's supply finished. So Yamada and 2 continued down to S Col without no oxygen and arrived S Col 3:30 pm; met Kitamura near South Summit (100m below) and he descended with Yamada to Col because leader said too late for him to continue. Yamada, Ang Lhakpa and Cerin Dorje to BC 6 May. Lang route from N side. Yamada and party 3 days above 8000m ""but we used oxygen - not so hard."" Used oxygen sleeping in C5 and C6 climbing above C6.

Letter from C. P. Bach

Kurt Diemberger, Hermann Warth and me left Tumlingtar on the 18/3. We got enough porters till Sedua, then the troubles began. We had great diffiuculties to get porters till Makalu base camp, they were cheating and difficult to handle. At last we reached our BC the 5-4-74, that is situated 1 day further in the glacier than Makalu BC. Altitude 5500m (in feet 16,500 ft). Today Diemberger and Warth established Camp 1 under the ridge/saddle of Cho Polu/Shartse in 6000m altitude.

Mr Lenser managed to transfer the rest of the equipment from Lukla to Tumlingtar on 31/3. So he will join us in a couple of days here in our base camp. Then the group is together and we hope our expectations will be fulfilled.",,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2447540,

When we see other side of Lhotse, this route not logical and there was great risk. Heinrich, Szulc and Chalecki in late Sept from C3. 3 reached South Col and saw this. Most go around rocks and unlogical; much more logical from C4 direct to summit but strong winds drove them into normal route via colouir for protection.
 
Weather very clear and sunny but wind very strong.
3 gendarmes on Chinese side. 3 members to summit without oxygen: Kukuczka, Czok and Niklas.

1st planned 5 and 5 in each of 2 summit parties but late reduced to 4 and 4 members of 2 summit teams. No 3rd team planned, but had support teams.

Very good co-operation with Germans in Icefall in making route. 

No Sherpas, so all members worked very hood. All reached C2 twice or more; 11 to C4.


Hans Van Kaenel - 19 Oct 79 (Everest expedition)

Poles tried to cross Col and climb from north but found north side too dangerous and difficult; cornices, rock gendarmes, avalanche danger. So actually used same route as Van Kaenel's German expedition in spring 1977.


Shailendra Raj Sharma, Ministry of Tourism - 9 Oct 79
(From LO on 7 Oct)

Summit 4 Oct:
1)  Zygmunt Heinrich, with oxygen
2)  Janusz Skorek, with oxygen
3)  Jerzy Kukuczka, no oxygen
4)  Andrzej Czok, no oxygen

At 12:50 hours on top; Nepal and Poland flags, photos; stayed 30 minutes.

All well. Other 2 summits teams to attack.


Kosiar - 9 Aug 79

Most members with baggage leave KTM 10 Aug, Koisar and Bilczewski leave 11 Aug - meet at Lamosangu and all leave Lamusangu 12 Aug on march-in.

Tourism Ministry has specifically stated expedition is permitted to cross South Col and climb to Lhotse's summit from east - may divide summit assault into 3 teams:

1) from Col towards top on East Face make route part way and return to Col camp
2) go to summit from Col and descend via Lhotse West Face 
3) go to summit via Lhotse West Face

East Face summiters will be out of radio contact with BC while they're on East Face. 2nd team at Col to keep contact with them.

Whether to divide into 3 parties as above depends on weather and speed of progress: if it takes 6-7 weeks to get very high, this can work, but if takes 8 weeks, will go to top the easiest way possible.

Border must be at Col and over ridge to Lhotse, Lhotse ""Intermediate"" and Lhotse Shar summits, but Ministry did not raise the subject and neither did Poles. Ministry denied permit to climb all the way to Lhotse Intermediate because it's a summit, but not on list.


Koisar & Bilczewski - 1 Aug 79

Route = South Col and East with C5 on face about 8250m, descent perhaps by West Face.

Leave KTM soon as possible after other members arrive by truck from Bombay. 6 to 8 weeks for climb.

No Sherpas above BC. Have 20 climbers. Popowicz and Szulc not counted. Popowicz not above BC and maybe not there; Szulc not above BC. [Note: Popowicz went to C3].

Use oxygen, above 7800m for sleeping and above 8000m for climbing.


Letter from Heinrich - 24 Sept 79

Sept 17th we established camp 3 on the altitude 7200m. It was established by the team Adam Bilczewski, Janusz Skorek, Andrzej Czok, Andrzej Heinrich, Jerzy Kukuczka, Janusz Baranek. It is located to the right of the Geneva Ridge on the face of Lhotse. During the tow next days the camp was arrived through 4 members teams who carried endorsement. On Sept 24th the same team headed by Bilczewski established camp 4 on the altitude 7850m in around 2 pm.

Last week the weather was not very good. Strong wind in the Western Cwm, snowfall and fog make the climbing difficult. But last two days (23 and 24 Sept) was very nice weather, sun no clouds.

Our expedition has established the camp 2 on Sept 10th, 9 o'clock am on the altitude 6500m. It is located under the face of Mt Everest in the upper part of Western Cwm. The camp 2 was established by A. Czok, J. Skorek, A. Heinrich, J. Kukuczka, J. Baranek and Howard Nesheim. In the camp 2 there are 3 tents. Now all members transport the equipment to endorsement camp 2. Weather it still good.


Letter - 16 Aug 79

After 22 days caravan the expedition arrived the Sept 3rd, the Base Camp. The first part of the caravan from Lamosangu to Namche Bazar was very bad. Porters still ran away. The naike has stolen some goods and equipment and also ran away. At last in Junbesi the very young sirdar Nima Sherpa leaved from the caravan. He has no experience and was not able to control the porters. We must every day arrange new porters. At last the caravans was divided in 4 parts arrived Namche Bazar. The new sirdar Anu carried on without trouble, very correctly the caravan in 5 days from Namche to BC camp. We arrived BC the Sept 3rd. The September 6th was established camp 1 above the Icefall, on the altitude about 6050m. The weather is good all members are by good health and condition.

Messner and Dawa Tenzing went up to Everest C2 on 8th Oct and pitched two-man tent, then back to BC.

Messner agreed to wait for Italian-Nepalese Everest team to go to Lhotse themselves. By 15th Santon said they were not attempting Lhotse, so he went up to C2 on 15th and next day to Everest C3. Carried light tent and other gear to C3. Climbed with Everest Sherpas (Dati had reached age 26 and this an inauspicious year in which to undertake hazards without puja which he not done). On 17th tried to go top summit but wind too strong, couldn't stand up against it as soon as he got above Nuptse ridge, so went down to BC was strong enough to go back up for another try but Everest expedition pulling out, route not to be maintained in Icefall and no one to go with. Impossible to go through Icefall alone if route not maintained - so made no further attempt. Had wanted Diemberger to come from South Col and join him, but Everest leader Santon refused permission to Diemberger.


Shailendra Sharma, Tourism - 17 Oct 80

Messner left 7400m at 3:00 am and reached 7800m at 7:00 am; very bad weather (high wind, thick clouds and very cold). He returned to BC at 12:00 noon. Because of continuous of bad weather, he has abandoned climb and leaves BC 20th.


Shailendra Sharma, Tourism - 16 Oct 80

Messner has gone alone to C3 and reached there today. Left BC yesterday at 6:00 am; above C3 he makes his own route.

Used Italian Icefall route and reached C2 at 11:00 yesterday.
Today arrived C3 9:00 am; had left C2 5:30-6:00 am.
Was not accompanied by Dawa Tenzing, but today from C2 to C3 by an Italian

Tourism Ministry have told him not to go into Khumbu Icefall until 15 Oct to keep peace with Italy-Nepal expedition.

Messner said will take him a week to go top once he starts through Icefall. (Santon refused to talk on BC radio with Messner last week).

Just under couloir at about 8050m was highest points reached on 2 Feb by Da Polenza above; not to Col but level with Col.

Impossible to go to top because couloir only hard rock instead of ice and snow. Expedition not equipped for this rock: needed 4 or 5 days more to scale this.

15 days high up, they had learned by then and could stay at high altitude no longer; weather worse than expected, more cold and stronger wind than expected.

All have little frostbite and Da Polenza more on little finger right hand which will heal.

Bianchi slipped into crevasse into Icefall 35-40m; very lucky that big rucksack stopped his fall. Near bottom of Icefall when leaving mountain.

No oxygen used climbing or sleeping.

Sherpas worked badly in winter although had same clothing as members.

Very hard and very difficult to climb in winter in Nepal; need better equipment for winter especially.

Italians planned to leave BC ?th and should be in KTM 12th. One member went up Japanese ropes to South Col but this not their route. He was expedition's only real climber, Agostino Da Polenza. Expedition got very little above C3 on their own route.

Report about accident on Sept 15

Just after we established Camp 2 (at 6200m on Sept 14), we had 2 members in C2, 2 members in C1 (5750m). Our programme for Sept 15 was that, from BC will start next team to C1 (Czeslaw Jakiel, Walenty Fiut, Alois Brugger). They began walking from BC at 5:30 am crossing the Lhotse Glacier. At 6:20 am they have started to climb by snow stones slope towards the south face of Lhotse. After few minutes they have seen a big avalanche, it began very high on the right side of south face. They tried to escape, but avalanche came very quickly. Alois Brugger had fallen to the small crevasse. Walenty Fiut fixed his ice axe and kept himself. Czeslaw Jakiel walked last and they didn't see what he was doing, that moment. After avalanche came and Alois Brugger tried to find out friends. He found Walenty Fiut about 100m below, he was injured but alive and 20m for Czeslaw Jakiel, unfortunately he was dead, probably due to strong hit on his head (whole on back side). In the meantime avalanche pression had reached BC. Olev friends took binoculars and they have seen somebody running between victims. Immediately they started to rescue them. That accident have seen two members from C1 and they went down too. About 1 hour after accident, all members (except Kurt Walde and me) reached that place and began to help victims. They put Walenty Fiut on the board with diagnose...he has fracture left leg and hip and probably ribs. He was in very bad condition, before he lost consciousness and after he has been in shade. Alois Brugger was well. Members again have checked Czeslaw Jakiel, but he was dead. At 9 am they send Sardar Ang Kami to Namche Bazar for helicopter. Me and Kurt Walde reached accident place at 11:30 am. We decided to carrying Walenty Fiut to BC and secure Czeslaw body. BC we have reached at 4 pm.

On Sept 16 we carried Walenty Fiut 20 minutes down, BC where we found good platform for helicopter, it was about 5100m high. Their we made a biv. Afternoon we have gone to Czeslaw body and we have made a funeral. We left him in about 15m deep crevasse and fill up up ice, snow and stones, close to accident place at 5300m below the south face. On Sept 17 at 9:30 am we have got a helicopter rescue, we put Walenty Fiut on stretcher and he flew with leader towards KTM (11:30 am).",Jakiel killed by avalanche on Sep 15; Fiut broken leg from same avalanche,Highest point ever reached on S Face,Asian Trekking,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453000,ASTREK

They spent 3 weeks on the N Face, making C1 and C2 in snowholes and pitching C3 at 6500m at the top of the Dutch Rib on 9th May. C3 was stocked during the following few days (9-12 May), but it was never slept in. 13th Duff and 3 went up with personal gear to C2 and 14th to C3. On 14th May, when Duff, Woodall, Nowack and Gray tried to move above C3, just a meter or 2 above the camp they got onto a serac barrier that was extremely broken and dangerous. It would have been safe enough, Duff felt, for 2 people going up and down once, but some of the team's client members were not sufficiently experienced for a rapid ascent. It would have been necessary to fix the rope to 1 more camp, thus requiring 20 passes through the barrier; this would have been unacceptably dangerous (and bad for business - members were paying clients). So the climb was abandoned. Snowholes very good idea for C2. All members reached C3 as did both Sherpas, but it was never slept in.",None,,Rover Treks,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2454111,

Wanda arrived at BC 7 Nov, day after all had left BC, including BC staff; had had no news of Wanda, who was due to arrive on 20 Oct and if had not evacuated equipment then, all would have been lost because one week later porters could not cross passes.

Three Sherpas (Lhakpa, Ang Zangbu and Ang Kitar) reportedly reached the summit at that time. However, when the HAJ (Himalayan Association of Japan) and the Tribhuvan Univ. Joint team first challenged this peak in 1982 Spring; they climbed all high peaks comprising main range. This fact is apparently denying above British claim [of 1st ascent].

Fernandez, Quetglas and Tirtha Tamang went up to C2 on 27 Sept. 28th Quetglas left C2 6:00 am Chinese time and arrived at C3 9:00 am with very cold toes. Went into Japanese tent, which was empty at the time because Japanese were going to summit, and used Japanese cooker, etc., to heat water to warm his feet. The C3 established by Wanda and Christian was now gone. Stayed 3 hrs until sun was on the face, then at 12:00 up. Met descending Japanese at 8000m at about 3:00 pm, and reached summit at 5:00 pm; returned to C2 and slept there.

Fernandez on 28th to C3 with Tirtha Tamang. 29th both to 7800m, then Ferandez developed stomach trouble and both to BC same day and climb finished (this was same day USSR and US climbers reached summit). Quetglas and Fernandez then went to Xixabangma, where they joined Spanish team, but no summit success.

De Dea claims to have reached summit bid but did not - Wanda by telephone 1 Oct.

This area's N and S faces were rock 3000m from top of ridge down to very steep snow and same snow on top of ridge. Very steep rock faces also in section beyond gully in another step before final climb to summit. On Tibet side of gully is couloir. Far west side of gully was a shelf which used in traverse.

Mazur 29 Oct: Balyberdin did not pay Icefall toll demanded by expedition and made own route close to bottom of W Shoulder, from which there was avalanching ""constantly."" 1 avalanche took out 4 fixed lines at 6:30 one morning in late Sept. Then Balyberdin gave some supplies (oxygen?) to Nepalis and was allowed onto Nepalese Icefall route. There also was avalanching from S Col to C2 bergschrund area. ""Russians take great risks."" B & B's ascent on 7th was not solely to acclimatize for speed climb: wanted to reach summit.

French women arrived BC late Aug, 10th Sept and began 15th Sept. At BC Pasang Lhamu's husband said no climbers from any expedition had right to try summit before Pasang Lhamu tried. Europeans had not signed any paper to this effect.

Pasang made her 1st attempt on 30th Sept. Pasang Lhamu angry that Besson joined her 30th Sept attempt (he had waited 1 day in S Col for her - ""she can't stop me; they don't want to carry my oxygen so I carry it myself."" Reached S Summit (Asselin reached same route as S summit) then time too late and strong wind and big clouds; so went down and met Pasang 50m below S Summit and she turned back here, 1/2 hr from S Summit and her 5 Sherpas an hour later; all down to C2 and BC. 

Europeans made their attempt on 3rd Oct. When arrived at col to try for top on 4th, winds very strong and only Mauduit stayed at col while others down (Mauduit stayed because Karl and Apa Sherpa arriving col that day and troubles with Pasang Lhamu). Mauduit ready to go up at midnight but Apa not well and did not want to go up, Karl not willing to go up without him and Mauduit decided not to go above without oxygen; so on 5th all 3 down. Mauduit's and Karl's plan to go to top was in violation of new order from Pasang's husband that foreign member do not go ahead of her.

3rd summit attempt: Pasang, Besson, Nawang Thile, Babu and Dawa Tashi Sherpa from BC and arrived at col. Got no one up because of wind and 10th noon all down and in descent took down C4. Met Mauduit at C2, not allowed to go to on top to C4 and on 11th dismantled C4 and C2 and climb obviously finished although on 10th 1 Russian Gerglan and 1 member reached summit later that day. At col on 29th Besson had to sleep in Spanish tent because Sherpas said no room for him.

Pasang very slow especially on descent and not good technically. She was official leader, but leaders were her husband and sirdar; she did not know how to lead.

6 Oct - Pasang Lhamu: There were 10 Nepali members (8 Sherpas and 2 Gurungs) and 5 Sherpas in Icefall and carrying loads only and 1 Sherpa, Apa, hired by Karl Huyberechts to help him. Of these 10 members, six made summit bids: on 1st bid of 30th Sept, they were Pasang Lhamu, Sonam Tshering, Dawa Tashi, Nawang Thile, Babu Tshering and Iman Gurung; on 2nd bid of 7-8 Oct (not 9-10th Oct) same members except Sonam Tshering. In both bids, oxygen used at and above C4 by Pasang Lhamu, Sonam Tshering, Nawang Thile, Dawa Tashi; Babu and Iman used none at all; other Nepalis, who went to C4 but did not sleep there used none.

On 30th Sept Besson of this expedition and Asselin of French expedition went ahead while Pasang Lhamu and her 5 Nepalis waited just below S Summit for their report of conditions ahead. Besson and Asselin returned after 1/2 hour and reported not possible to go beyond S Summit because of wind and soft snow; 2 Frenchmen descended, Pasang Lhamu and party went up anyway, reached S Summit and descended part way to small dip before ascent to Hillary Step, then turned back because of wind.

On 7th Oct Pasang Lhamu and 4 Nepalis arrived at C4 to go to summit next day but wind prevented anyone from going higher. After waiting till 3:00 pm they descended to C2. They had meeting at C2 that evening: Pasang Lhamu and her 4 Nepalis, Sonam Tshering, Besson, Chantal Mauduit, Karl Huyberechts and Apa. Karl wanted to make summit bid soon but he found that his oxygen regulator was not working and he would not try without oxygen; Chantal wanted to try for summit, but not with Karl; Besson not interested in 3rd attempt nor was Pasang, so it was decided climb was finished and C4 would be - and was - brought down next day.

Ministry of Tourism had asked other Everest expeditions and foreign members of Pasang Lhamu's expedition to give her first chance at summit but nothing was put in writing and she, her husband and her sirdar Sonam Tshering did not tell others they had to wait for her.


Asselin, etc - 16 Oct 91
French Everest Expedition

Nepal-French-Belgian Everest expedition had problems between European and Nepalese members:
- items of written agreement by which Europeans pledged to give Pasang Lhamu 
  priority on summit bid; Europeans did not realize how this would affect their
  own summit chances.
- food provided by Nepalese not to Europeans taste.
- oxygen not supplied by Nepalese.
Europeans paid Nepalese $5000 each to join expedition.


Sonam, Thamserku Trekking - 4 Oct 1991

Pasang Lhamu, Asselin and 5 Sherpas reached 96m below top in 100 mkh wind. She and sirdar at 8400m at midnight. Started from South Col 1:30 am and she back at South Col 10:00 am (her Sherpas earlier). All down to BC, 2nd Oct. 5th or 6th up again. All other teams waited for her to make trail and some were above South Summit yesterday and turned back. Very dangerous cornices above South Summit. 

Summit bid 15 Sept and C3 reached, then avalanche. Pivot and Groom as well as Pasang Lhamu made this bid.


To Rising Nepal (Kathmandu), 2 Oct 1991 by Jean Michel Asselin of French team

The Highest Night

It was the second night we spent at the South Col at nearly 8000m of altitude. We the members of two expeditions; that of the first Nepalese women to attempt Mount Everest, and the French Expedition called Namaste. In total we were twelve. This second night was again marked by terrifying gusts of winds and I could not believe that at one o'clock in the morning we could leave our tents and go towards the summit of Mt Everest over 900m higher.

30 Sept: at 01:30 after putting on my crampons, I followed the steps of Sonam Tshering the sirdar of Pasang Lhamu, on to the great snow slopes leading to the southeast Ridge. Often I watched Pasang Lhamu and asked myself where did she find the courage to do what we were doing. It was very cold and the effort was so intense, that no matter who would  haveno hesitation in turning back. 

Reaching the ridge, we discovered the most beautiful landscape view in the world. The sun helped everyone feel a little better assisted by the attraction of the summit which we felt close.

I confess I was fascinated by the three Sherpas who were climbing without using bottled oxygen. Unfortunately for me, the snow, which until now was quite hard, became very soft and we sank through up to our waists and sometimes up to our chests. It was then that our progress already difficult became extremely slow. This slope which allows access to the South Summit and which is inclined at 50 degrees took us over two hours of effort. Every 15 metres one or other of us would take lead, knowing very well that here we would require all our force to reach the nearby summit.

At 3 o'clock in the afternoon after fourteen hours of extreme effort we reached the South Summit of Everest at 8770m. It was already a good victory, but for total success there remained a further 100m. At this moment the wind gushed at over 100 km/hr and I wasn't sure what to do. I therefore asked the closest Sherpa what he thought. Without hesitation he told me ""let's go."" It appeared inevitable to me to go to the summit in such a wind, but how does one doubt the words of a Sherpa who had already been twice to the summit of the roof of the world.

So we went, the two of us with a piece of rope in this strange high altitude world beaten by the violent wind. After about 100m, the snow disappeared under the steps of the Sherpa and dropped into the void. A this time we understood that it was futile to continue and we retraced our path to the South Summit. Climbing there I crossed Pasang always confident and told her that we would not reach the summit and that one should go down.

Thick mist began to form and envelope the mountain hiding the descent. Convinced that I was going to run out of oxygen, I ran down the slopes and exhausted, arrived at C4 (South Col) before night fall. The wind had again raged and I noticed with sadness that it had torn two tents. I threw myself into another where I was taken care of by two friends and immediately exhausted, I got into my sleeping bag, and tried to go to sleep fearing all the time that the tent would take off and fly away.

At midnight, Nawang Thile, a Sherpa with Pasang's expedition, came to the tent and told me ""Big problem, three people are not coming, probably Pasang!"" I was very worried because I knew it was impossible for a man or woman to survive at over 8000m without shelter with winds gusting at over 150 km/hr. But what could be done? In the state I was in I couldn't move. I gave Nawang Thile a drink and my headlamps but was sure that he was also powerless to intervene. He managed to climb a few hundred metres higher during the night in which a man and a women (both Sherpas) managed to survive. 

It was a unprecedented achievement (probably more difficult than climbing Everest) of Pasang Lhamu and Sonam Tshering. During the night hours, struggling ""against the cold, they showed that human beings have the strength to combat and beat the most hostile force of nature.""

When at nearly seven o'clock in the morning I saw Pasang arrive at tent like a ghost. I cried with joy. Tired, but alive, she was already thinking of her next attempt on her mountain. Sonam had got frostbite but his courage was intact. And for me as well the decision was made. I would go back towards the summit of Mt Everest with the woman who had lived through the highest bivouac in the world.

At 3 o'clock in the afternoon after fourteen hours of extreme effort we reached the South Summit of Everest at 8770m. It was already a good victory, but for total success there remained a further 100m. At this moment the wind gusted at over 100 km/hr and I wasn't sure what to do. I therefore asked the closest Sherpa what he thought. Without hesitation he told me ""let's go."" It appeared inevitable to me to go to the summit in such a wind, but how does one doubt the words of a Sherpa who had already been twice to the summit of the roof of the world.

So we went, the two of us with a piece of rope in this strange high altitude world beaten by the violent wind. After about 100m, the snow disappeared under the steps of the Sherpa and dropped in the void. At this time we understood that it was futile to continue and we retraced our path to the South Summit. Climbing there I crossed Pasang always confident and told her that we would not reach the summit and that one should go down.

Thick mist began to form and envelope the mountain hiding the descent. Convinced that I was going to run out of oxygen, I ran down the slopes and exhausted, arrived at C4 (South Col) before night fall. The wind had again raged and I noticed with sadness that it had torn two tents. I threw myself into another where I was taken care of by two friends and immediately exhausted, I got into my sleeping bag, and tried to go to sleep fearing all the time that the tent would take off and fly away.

At midnight, Nawang Thile, a Sherpa with Pasang's expedition, came to the tent and told me ""Big problem, three people are not coming, probably Pasang."" I was very worried because I knew it was impossible for a man or woman to survive at over 8000m without shelter with winds gusting at over 150 km/hr. But what could be done? In the state I was in I couldn't move. I gave Nawang Thile a drink and my headlamps but was sure that he was also powerless to intervene. He managed to climb a few hundred metres higher during the night in which a man and a women (both Sherpas) managed to survive.

It was a unprecedented achievement - probably mere difficult open climbing Everest of Pasang Lamu and Sonam Tshering. During the night hours, struggling ""against the cold, they showed that human beings have the strength to combat and beat the most hostile force of nature.""

When at nearly seven o'clock in the morning I saw Pasang arrive at tent like a ghost. I cried with joy. Tired, but alive, she was already thinking of her next attempt on her mountain. Sonam had got frostbite but his courage was intact. And for me as well the decision was made. I would go back towards the summit of Mt Everest with the woman who had lived through the highest bivouac in the world.

Soon as others on normal route Bruce up from C6; decided not to take a rope in interest if speed, but by time reached 8600m (below 2nd Step) had been on tricky rock terrain and Bruce now concerned that would be difficult to descend without rope here and turned back. Van Noorden went on and reached 3rd Step at 8700m. Now on final snow slope, decided Bruce correct and he also turned back in perfect weather. 

2nd attempt by Curry, Perry, Rheinberger and Whetu: arrived C6 10th June. Left at 4:00 am on 11th June, in light breeze and clear sky. By time 150m fixed rope to which took time and got cold. On above on easier ground but in increasingly stronger wind at 1st step (Curry only one on oxygen). 3 were suffering and extreme loss of body heat and Whetu and Perry's feet freezing. Wind was incredibly strong in afternoon, they could not see. Reached 8500m at 9:30 am and then turned back because there were freezing and Curry not masochist.

Finally allowed them permission to climb W Ridge, let them use Saleki's ropes and still big problems with them (especially the ethics of commercial expedition, on which leader had to teach members ice climbing at BC and members were guided on every step). They threatened to write against Saleki and ""finish him"" if he didn't let them to take over his route and thus ruining his plan & devout wish to be alone in his route; promised him $1000 for his lost equipment but didn't pay. They didn't expect their members to get above Saleki's C1. Habeler & Zabeleta were paid $15,000 each to guide clients. 

Saleki's Sherpas left expedition before C1 established. About 10th March they left after one carry above ABC. Saleki then overwhelmed by American team, who scrapped his plans for camp locations. He then slept in US C1 when they were not there and went to top of spur to W Shoulder but down because impossible to stay there while Americans on route.

After weeks of battling miserable weather and high winds, dealing with illness and injuries, repairing and replacing equipment -- plus Jim and Ray's encounter with the democratic revolution in Kathmandu, no one on the mountain would say it was easy. ""It just shows what can be accomplished through international cooperation and teamwork,"" said Whittaker. ""We had horrible conditions our first two months on the mountain. A lesser team would have been stopped. But we hung in there, got the routes and the camps in and carried up supplies. So we were in position to take advantage of the break when it finally came.""

The first summit group of six climbers left C6 on May 5 under less than ideal conditions: snow and wind. Lower on the mountain, it was snowing so hard that no one made carries to C4. But the next day, May 6th, dawned calm: it was one of the few windless days since the team had arrived at the Base Camp. Two Soviets (Grigory Luniakov and Sergei Arsentiev), two Chinese.

Da Cheme, Gyal Bu and two Americans (Robert Link and Steve Gall) left C7 at daybreak, negotiated the difficult ""Second Step"" and set foot on the summit at 1:13 pm Beijing time.

The first summit team descended through C6, some spending the night at C5, some at C4 and some at C3. Unbelievably, the weather held for another day, and before dawn on May 7, six more climbers left C6. Three of them (Ed Viesturs, Andrei Tselischev and Mistislav Gorbenko) climbed all the way to the summit, leapfrogging C7, and then descended to C6 - a feat never before accomplished on this route. And Viesturs and Tselischev managed it without the used of bottled oxygen.

The second three (Ian Wade, Gui Sang and Da Qoing) spent the night at C7 and ascended to the summit on May 8. They were joined there by two more climbers, Ren Na and Luo Tse, who had started the ascent that day from C6. On the radio from the summit, Ian Wade yelled, ""I'm on top! I feel fine! Now I want to get off here.""

On May 9, Jim reported from BC, ""It is the most beautiful day yet. The sun is shining and the mountain looks spectacular. Seven more climbers are heading up from C6 (Mark Tucker, Ekaterina Ivanova, Anatoly Mochnikov, Ervand Ilyinsky, Alexander Tokarev, Wang Ja, and Jia Tsuo). It looks like they have a good shot if the weather holds."" A few hours later, he called with the extraordinary news: ""Six of the seven made it to the top - twenty climbers in all, over a four day period: the most ever to reach the summit on a single expedition!"" Jia Tsuo descended because of frostbitten toes. He is expected to recover fully. But all the rest made the peak and descended without major problems.


Climb Progress Report:

Here is the itinerary followed by the Peace Climb from May 1 through May 16.

May 2  First day of good weather! First summit teams move to C5, second 
       group moves to C4. Jim and Ian carry loads to C4. Hanging from
       fixed rope, Jim is patched in by radio to Port Townsend HQ..live!
       Trekkers return to Base
May 4  Heavy snow and gusty winds at C3 and C4. First team moves to C6, 
       second to C5. Mark Tucker and Tim O'Brien carry from C4 to C5 and
       experience winds of 70 mph. They are airborne several times on
       the fixed line - they cache the loads and return to C4. Tuck
       returns to C3 to rest. Trekkers leave for Kathmandu.
May 5  Weather calm above Base. First team moves to C7, other teams 
       behind with one day separations. High avalanche danger between C3
       and C4 - no one moves on that route.
May 6  No wind! By 9:30 pm (Seattle time), the Peace Climb has 6 
       climbers on the summit. Port Townsend BC gets call from BC,
       patched to Jim at C3, then to Robert on the summit.
May 7  Three more climbers reach the summit by 9:00 pm (Seattle time). 
       Viesturs and Andrei do it without oxygen from C6 -- the first
       time anyone had gone from C6 to the summit and back on this route
       Robert and Steve down from C5 to C3, Da Cheme and Gyal Bu down
       from C3 to Base. All summit teams progress up the mountain,
       separated by one camp. Jim goes back to BC.
May 8  Third summit group puts five more on top! Gui Sang is the second 
       Chinese woman to reach the summit of Everest.
May 9  It's getting crowded at C6. Some coming down and a new team going
       up. A cloud cap on the summit, but no plume which means no wind. 
       At 7:00 pm (Seattle time) six more are on top, for a total of 
       twenty! Jim is ""stunned"" at this spectacular success. Ekaterina 
       is the first Soviet woman on the summit of Everest, and she 
       records a message to the women of the world. Jia Tsuo turns
       around below the summit with frostbitten feet and returns to C3
       where he receives treatment. On the way down the mountain, Ian
       Wilde suffers snowblindness and is treated by Dr. Kurt Papenfus at C4.
May 10 All summit climbers descend, cleaning up garbage and expedition
       gear as they move. ""We've probably picked up a couple of tons of 
       trash,"" says Whittaker. ""We brought down at least 50 old oxygen 
       cylinders from C4 alone. Maybe we'll shop some of it home and 
       auction it off to help pay the bills!"" Steve and Robert arrive at
       Base and drink a Rainier Beer. Ian's eyes feel better and sight
       is returning. Patti calculates that she has 24 more meals to prepare.
May 11 Team members from Base go up to C3 to pack it up for the yaks to 
       carry out. Tuck (Mark Tucker), Ian and Toly (Anatoly) down from 
       C3 to Base. Trekkers return to Seattle.
May 12 Clean up continues. Yaks at ill.
May 13 Tuck arrives at Base, gives Patti the day off and makes pancakes
       for all -- even though his fingers are black with frostbite (no
       permanent damage). ""Snowing like mad"" at Base. Jim and Warren 
       negotiate with Chinese regarding final payment for in-China expenses.
May 14 LaVerne Woods returns to Seattle. She is in good spirits and
       recovering well from thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism.
May 15 They're smelling the barn. Port Townsend HQ jumps through hoops, 
       leaps tall buildings and walks on water to change plane 
       reservations and get the team home a week early.
May 17 5:58 pm (Seattle) Point. Townsend HQ faxes congratulatory letter
       President Bush to the entire team at BC. 6:15 pm (Seattle) Last

Steep up to S Summit; avalanche danger at best and felt at any moment might go down Kangschung Face which in shadow; then sun popped up suddenly. Porzak used 1 liter/min part way, 2l/m most of way, 3l/m on summit. Porzak arrived at top about 7:15 am and stayed an hour. Ran out of oxygen in descent at 28,500 ft and arrived at Col in whiteout at 2:00 pm. He was surprised how steep SE Ridge was. 

Lapkass intended to be in Lhotse team, then changed his mind, shot up to Everest. There were 2 Swedes from NZ expedition and Macartney-Snape at Col and these 4 went to summit together. Left Col 9:30 pm on 10th May and was first on top next morning - ""it was a good trip, a good group of guys, great group of Sherpas.""

2 Sherpas went to S Col with May 10th summiters who stayed in C4, as per plan so they could help summit party.


Wally Berg - 27 May 90

10 minutes after we radioed from summit of Lhotse, the Sherpas were putting on city clothes and taking baths, despite Porzak's telling Sherpas in advance Berg and Fischer were to try Everest summit. Sherpas weren't ready to cooperate after other Everest successes and Lhotse's.

Berg and Fischer could have gone for Everest top with Swiss if Berg and Fischer were prepared to go no lower than C2 and join Swiss on 16th to Everest top, but Berg and Fischer needed BC rest first.

Slept few hours at Col, then down to BC on 17th, through unmaintained icefall where route had collapsed in some places. By now American's Sherpas had cleared C2 in Cwm. No chance to go up because Sherpas leaving 19th-20th and Swiss had gone up to Col too soon after ridge climb. Reason for cold toes was insufficient rest before going to Col. Swiss had made arrrangements with Americans for them to leave supplies and tents for Swiss to use and American's Sherpas agreed to stay and help until 19th May.

Everest - The end of an Apprenticeship

As Christchurch climber Rob Hall's voice boomed over the roof of the world, the 1990 Cold Water Surf Everest Challenge Expedition made the first broadcast from the summit of Everest direct into New Zealand homes.

For Hall as expedition organiser and Leader, reaching the top was culmination of three years effort which included two previous attempts on the mountain.

The summit of Everest effectively divides Chinese occupied Tibet from Nepal with snowflakes that fall on the top either ending up in the Tsang Po or the Ganges river catchments. As the three Kiwis were shaking hands, taking photographs and getting ready to dial up the New Zealand Prime Minister simply said to Gary ""I USSR"" handed him a postcard and asked Gary to take his pictures. Gary only had time to reply ""I Kiwi"" before the Soviet turned and stoped off down his ascent route, this climber was a member had already put 12 climbers on the summit over the previous ten days.

Soon after the three days New Zealanders began the descent of the South East Ridge back to their camp on the 8000m South Col they were engulfed in a storm. Unable to see properly they were forced to remove their goggles which immediately exposed them to high levels of UV radiation. Snow blindness was to severely hamper each of the climbers during the retreat to their 5700m base camp below the dreaded Khumbu Icefall. Snowblindness is a UV burn of the cornea which feels like having hot sand thrown in the eyes. It effectively means the eyes are too painfull to open.

Only twenty minutes below the summit the Kiwis met two other members of their international team who were sitll plodding upwards. Rudi Van Snick was soon to become the first Belgian to summit. He was accompanied by Apa Sherpa from Thame village only 50 kms from the base of the mountain. Unlike the other 14 support was invited as a friend and full climbing member of the team. Both Rudi and Apa were suffering from snowblindness by the time they reached the South Col just on dusk at 6 pm, a full two hours behind the New Zealanders. By now, Peter Hillary had descended to a lower camp in the Western Cwm.

The weather remained fine next day so Gary and Apa, with watery inflamed eyes, set off to grope their way downwards. Rob, as the least affected, stayed on the South Col to nurse a totally blind Rudi. They lay in the tent sucking oxygen through a mask. Meanwhile, two of the three Swedish members of Rob's team, Michael Reutersvard and Oskar Kihlborg, both 26 year old, had made their own way to the summit. As the first Swedes on the summit they look great pleasure in calling the King of Sweden on the Satellite-linked radio.

The Swedes spotted the lanky Australian climber, Tim Macartney-Snape, high above the South Col that day. Unlike their own ascent and that of the others in their team including, the New Zealanders, this Australian was travelling alone and wasn't using bottled oxygen. Everest is climbed regularly now without oxygen since Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler first proved the feat possible in 1978.

Rob Hall finally joined Peter and Gary at BC on May 13th, having had an epic job guiding the still partially blind Rudi down the steep icy Lhotse Face (one serious fall) then through the 500m Khumbu Icefall - chaotic jumble of crumbling ice towers that has claimed many lives in the past. The relief in his voice when interviewed at base camp for this story was more than noticeable. As he said ""only now have I truly climbed my Everest.""

10 days of bad weather in late April and early May and during this period friction arose between Poles and Basques because of uneven abilities: Tomas did outstanding job of fixing ice wall. Alduz the other experienced Basque lost interest in climb after avalanche. 2 others very young and one of them twice had acclimatization problem; inexperienced Basques had no experience carrying loads. Communication difficult between Basque and Poles: Basques wanted to make summit attack in a large party which meant low last camp, cramped in tents, poor sleep, etc. Team made to 7600-7800m and forced back by bad weather. Spaniards had fixed departure date from Nepal and had to hurry: wouldn't wait for making C4, instead made summit push from C3 which failed; this was only summit bid because weather continued to be bad with heavy clouds and snowfall. Basques informed leader very late that they had to leave BC on 15th May. Another problem was that other 2 Polish women wanted to climb only with Basques. Czerwinska and Palmowska were in C3 on 13th waiting to go up on 14th to make a C4 and go for top, but on 14th windy and cloudy. Actual summit attack began at 10:00 pm on 12th in wind.

Actually was possible for Basques to stay beyond 15th May: on 16th Tomas and Ochoa actually decided to try push to top and went up from BC for one hour & then decided loads too heavy. Communication problem was not language problem but younger climbers did not listen to older Polish leaders, who had climbed with Aldaz on Makalu and counted on him to be communicator, but when he had narrow miss with big avalanche of seracs, he lost interest in climb and stayed mostly in BC, went no higher (and wanted to go no higher) than C1.

Could see face and listen for rock fall (was much rockfall when clear in daytime and sun was on S Face); then very dangerous. 18th rest at BC. 19th acclimatized to 7150m on SE Ridge (nearly to C3 on 87) and back to BC. 20th to 6000m on SE Ridge, felt well acclimatized and didn't want to waste strength going higher on ridge so back to BC. 21 rest at BC. 22nd started up; after lunch to bottom of face with doctor carrying extra food for Cesen to eat at bottom of face where had left gear (100m of 6m rope, 6-9 rock pitons, 19 ice pitons all of titanium, sleeping bag, biv sack, walkie-talkie, no stove or gear, extra gloves, socks and goggles; crampons, harness and ice ax, 1 piece Italian pile with down inside jumpsuit, helmet, head lamp, Neoprene gaiters; food; 3 liters liquid in 3 thermoses; still camera and extra film but never took off gloves to change film or open the camera.

Doctor returned to BC while Cesen started up face at 5 pm from 5200m; climbed during night and stopped at 8 am at 7500m to rest & because of danger of rockfall and snow avalanching (every afternoon light snowfall and some wind) which was stronger in valley than higher) and slept 5 hrs here in very safe snow ledge under overhanging rock spur; 1:00 pm started up again under shady sky and climbed to 11:00 pm bottom of rock band at 8200m after continuous climb till 5-6:00 pm and then fog obscured face and needed to wait till could see until after 9:00+ pm because clear weather. 2nd biv at 8200m, a biv ""I want to forget as soon as possible"" because very cold (""shaking all the night""), high altitude and remember 8400m-Yalung Kang biv after teammate fell to his death. Biv was just under rock band pillar which ends at summit ridge; safe place and not steep; did not sleep beause of danger of freezing to death. Started again up at 5:00 am. On 24th most difficult part was just above biv and was 50-70m high: bad rock, steep, unconsolidated snow below onto rock - here used rock piton, climbed up to it and put in 2nd piton. Took 3 hrs to overcome this difficulty at such high altitude. At biv left rucksack, sleeping bag, food, biv sack. At top of difficult part left rope fixed for descent (not to come down W Face - carrying this gear was too much to carry). 15m above difficult part came onto ridge which was not tecnically difficult but deep snow and had to traverse this long ridge. Then down to col and finally up 50m to top at 2:20 pm on 24th. On difficult part stopped to rest after exhausting climbing; this finished at 8:20 am; above that also many rests but now only for short periods; ""terrible"" wind on top and too dangerous to extend on very top but stood 2m below it.  

Immediately down after brief walkie-talkie contact with BC. Weather now worse and worse with wind and snow and came down fast as possible but at 7800m stopped an hour because of avalanche which swept him 50-100m at 45-degree slope and many more avalanches coming down. Not injured but frightened by it; continued on down when no avalanches and face clear, found pitons which used abseiling down. Stopped again with clouds obscured face, slight snowfall, feared weather would get worse (but no wind in afternoon and night) and made biv at 9:00 pm for 3 hrs (did not sleep). At midnight weather clear and started down again and descended continuously till 7:00 am to bottom face, where doctor met him with food and drink, rest 2-1/2 hours back to BC at 11-12 on 25th. Felt very good in BC that afternoon: mentally exhausted by having to be so carefull in descent, avalanche fright and sound of many avalanches down Polish route; but not physically exhausted that day. Next day physically exhausted. Left BC 28th April. Total 45 hrs from bottom of face to top including stops. 62 hrs from bottom of face to bottom of face.

NOTE: Cesen's ascent is now generally doubted by others in part because photos of summit claimed to have been taken by Cesen were taken by Victor Groselj from an earlier expedition. See ""Reasonable Doubt"" by Greg Child, Climbing magazine, 142, Feb 1, 1994 


Yugoslavian Lhotse expedition - Spring 1990

Tomo Cesen's amazing feat of soloing Lhotse's formidable south face brought instant praise and fame. But doubts about his claim began to be raised not long afterwards when a compatriot, Viktor (Vikki) Groselj protested that Cesen had published  Groselj's photographs as his own. I talked with to Tone Skarja, a senior figure in Yugoslavia/Slovenian mountaineering, about this on 13 Dec 93, and he said he believed Cesen's account was true. In the beginning after his return from Nepal, Cesen said he had no camera and therefore no pictures, but under pressure from his sponsors, after several months he produced some slides which turned out to be those taken by Groselj. Skarja explained to me that Cesen is a ""simple person,"" did not think ahead to the problems that could develop, and ""now he is a confused man.""

A Soviet expedition of 17 climbing members with no high-altitude Sherpas went to the South Face in 1990 autumn and managed to put two members on the top with the use of bottled oxygen on their summit day, despite considerable technical difficulties and severe cold. One summiter, Sergei Bershov, told me of his grave doubt that one man alone could have climbed the face, and they later publicly suggested that perhaps he had reached the middle summit.

Reinhold Messner gave Cesen great praise and an award for the South Face solo soon after the climb said he believed Cesen's account, but after doubts were raised by a number of people, Messner stated that he now did not believe or disbelieve Cesen.

In a 1994 issue of Climbing Magazine (February 1-March 15 issue) was an article titled ""Reasonable Doubt"" by the Australian mountaineer and writer about climbing, Greg Child who thoroughly examined Cesen's claim and concluded that ""there is really no way of knowing [whether Cesen summited or not], short of climbing that awesome wall and searching for the pitons Cesen told me left above 27,000 feet.""

Another Slovenian climber, who accomplished remarkable face climbs in the 1990's, Tomaz Humar, said to me on 9 Sept 1999 that Cesen's accounts of his Lhotse climb have not stood up under detailed questioning. (Humar said Greg Child's article about Cesen's Lhotse claim was excellent). Humar also said that now people are even questioning Cesen's climb of Jannu in the spring of 1989; he does no more climbing and lives in obscurity.


1 June 2000

Re: Tom Cesen, Lhotse

Slovenian Lhotse expedition leader and both summiters are sure Cesan did not reach summit in Spring 1990. ""No one believe him now"" about this claim on his Jannu ascent in 1989 spring or his claim to historic ascents or five peaks in Alps in winter (before Jannu).


Tone Skarja - 13 Feb 93

Skarja believes Cesen did climb Lhotse. In the beginning after his return from Nepal, he said he had no camera and therefore no pictures, but under pressure from his sponsors, after several months he produced slides, which turned out to be sections of Groselj pictures.

Cesen is ""a simple person,"" did not think ahead to the problems that could develop and is now a confused man.


Tomazin, Slovene Xixa - 17 Sept 93

Cesen used Groselj pictures of Lhotse without immediately denying Vertical's credition them to Cesen.

Cesen has said reaching 8000m summit is not the important thing, where Groselj is trying for all 14.

Skarja sides with Groselj in their feud but Skarja is considered too dictatorial and domineering by many climbers especially young ones.

To Tomaju's knowledge Messner has not contradicted Cesen's Lhotse claim.


Tomaz Humar - 7 Nov 2006

Tomaz Humar's comments about Tomo Cesen's claimed ascent via the South Face: ""It is possible Tomo did make the summit.... I don't say he did, but I don't say he didn't."" When people can't do something themselves, they say no one can. Humar has seen the South Face, and he thinks Cesen could have gone all the way to the top alone. He was a very strong climber. Lhotse's South Face is not so difficult as Jannu's North Face, which Cesen also said he soloed. Humar also has seen Jannu's North Face and thinks it is possible that he summited. Tomaz also believes that the Jannu face is more difficult because of the greater danger of falling rock on the face.",Frostnip of toes and fingers (they have no feeling but otherwise OK),1st solo of S Face,Wilderness Adventure,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2454091,

On 19th reached their ""hidden"" mountain itself and began climbing slope which got steeper in due course becoming SW Ridge; made camp at 6200m (by all 3 climbing members) but northwest winds stormed so fiercely that decided to descend to camp at 6200m camp. Whole night and next day storm continued, so abandoned attempt. Northwest winds from Tibet blast Langtang Ri, which is unprotected.

Had problems reaching BC over glacier and deposited goods 6 hours before BC.

LO died on 18 Oct - was sick and chopper requested. Tourists actually came in and he ran to chopper at Kyanju and collapsed at 3750m. Never was at BC, died of heart attack? Climbers learned of his death on 23 Oct from villagers. Liaison officer's name was Gopal Bahadur KC.

French Langtang Lirung's LO was told expedition Langtang Ri's LO had intense stomach and pain in kidney area: Langtang Lirung's Ms Mathiew, 7 Nov 1990.

First tried to get into S Face directly but found huge icefall a big as Khumbu Icefall and very active (icefall should have been crossed going to face directly at 19,500 ft, but make no attempt to do so). 28th Oct decided to get to S Face via SE Ridge, which leads onto S Face and made C1 on 28th; 29th Burgess and Dawa Wangchu (Kharte near Kharikhola) went on recce to see if feasible to SE Ridge and decided it was and back to C1. 30th set out for ridge (and summit if possible, but this a ""long shot""). Burgess, Golden, Whiteley, Nobles and Dawa Wangchu left C1 at 4:00 am; Nobles turned back after an hour (trouble with crampons and not entirely well) while other 4 continued. At 11:00 am were about 200 ft below SE Ridge and here Whiteley and Golden 300 ft behind Burgess and Dawa Wangchu. Dawa Wangchu was now leading and put in ice stake and Burgess climbed up to him and from there Dawa was to go on up and put in ice stake that would be better anchored. Dawa anchored rope and came down his fixed line and tied on another rope to fixed rope but became disconnected from fixed rope (probably rope broke after he had untied a knot Burgess had put there to tie off a flaw in the rope). Dawa fell 800 vertical feet (1000 ft in distance) but was still alive having ended at bottom of a section of very dangerous ice cliffs landing in deep snow. Burgess reached him in 30 minutes: he had massive head injuries (fractured skull) and bleeding from skull profusely and coughing blood. Burgess stayed with him 3 hrs, got him standing, could see but couldn't speak; tried to pull him down steep snow slope and got him down 60 ft and then Dawa disconnected his harness and took off gloves and turned away from Burgess and lay down signaling Burgess to go. Burgess left him. Now ice and ice cliffs will soon take him all the way down (he probably would have died in next half hour).

All 4 members returned to BC same day. 2 days rest at BC, then took equipment to C1. Peter got sick (flu) and went down to Pangboche. On 15th Oct other 3 members up to British C2 and Rainer worked hard with Harper to fix mushroom ridge which his wife ferried loads from C1. 18th Rainer and others 2 down to BC, where Peter was now, in stormy weather. 21st all moved up again, Peter to C1 and other three to C2. 22nd Peter to C3 (in slightly different site from British) while other three went for summit.

Detail of Summit

22 Oct 1990: Mr Rainer Bolesch (leader - German) started from C2 at 6 am and reached the summit at 12:30 pm; stayed on the summit for 10 minutes, took photographs only and later descended to C1 and stayed overnight.

Note: Mr Rainer Bolesch had accompanied with his wife Eva Maria Bolesch and Joerg Zengerle from C2 towards the summit on 22 Oct but only Rainer Bolesch had managed to reach the summit and the other two members had waited 250m below the summit for Mr Rainer and later three of them came together to C1 and stayed overnight.

23 Oct 1990 - Mr Peter Bolesch started from C3 at 8:30 am and reached the summit at 11 am, stayed on the summit for 1/2 hour and took photographs and later descended to BC which he finally reached at 5 pm.

26 Oct 1990 - Once again Rainer Bolesch along with his wife Eva Maria Bolesch (German Nurse) and the other climber Joerg Zengerle started from C2 at 6 am and three of them managed to reach the summit at 12:30 pm stayed on the summit for 1/2 hour, took photographs only and later descended to C2 which they reached at 2:30 pm.

Note: this was the second time summit for Mr Rainer Bolesch (leader).

27 Oct 1990 - Three members which had stayed on C2 overnight, reached the BC.

Left cave at 8:30 am (waited for sun, befelled by no oxygen and under estimated distance of summit). Took 2 ropes and 1 bottle of oxygen for later use - took much time to reach ledge (rock covered by snow on last 20 minutes below ledge and then hard rock) which got to 4:00 pm Karataev sick with flu, moved slowly and joined Bershov only at 5:15 pm 30-40m below summit. Had used oxygen on hard rock in morning for 3 hours. Finally on top about 6:00 pm together, stayed few minutes in strong wind with gusts from different directions.

When descending felt he was a bed sheet on clothes line; Karataev now got pneumonia and frostbite (lost his glove and took moment to put on another one). One returned to cave at 2:45 am and other at 4:45 am and had to wait radio on stove just turned off so as to report safe arrival. First made liquids to drink (spent some hours), other slept till evening. Began descent 18th morning and reached small cave and met by Turkevich and others who helped them in descent. Turkevich could have gone to summit but turned back to help Karataev and Bershov. A member and Turkevich were strongest of team and did very hard work making route.

On S Pillar, put C3 at 7100m on 12th Sept and during following 7 days fixed ropes to 7700m slightly to right of pillar. In this period 2 Sherpas hit by powdered avalanche and was left dangling on ropes and another was hit in ribs by falling block of ice (but resumed climb later on and reached col (Ang Rita from Thami, but not THE Ang Rita). On 19th avalanche covered the ropes, which could be pulled out, but the 5 clients were getting apprehensive about going up those lines so route changed to S Col (LO gave permission before ministry agreed).

US team claims that Batard team made extensive use of US C4 equipment without permission. Batard left quickly with others while Karl Huyberechts and Annie Dubois left without food at BC; US team fed them. US changed to S Col route by moving gear from pillar C3 directly across to Lhotse Face where pitched another C3 at 7400m (members traversed across, Sherpas down to Cwm and up). Col reached on 28th Sept and on 29th summit bid by Lowe and Culver reached only 100m above Col; Col now this morning abandoned by team because of strong winds. 30th Sept all to BC because of wind even at C2 and some snowfall. 

On 2nd Oct Nelson with a US Sherpa, Lowe and Culver at C4 to make summit bid but had pulmonary edema on arrival and down sick.

On 4th Lowe, Culver and Salino of De La Ferriere expedition left C4 together at 9:00 am when wind stopped suddenly. Lowe pulled ahead of others and reached top about 1-1/2 hours ahead of them. [Lowe summited at 12:30 pm and Culver at 2 pm.]

Lowe reported tricky climbing beyond S Summit so Aprin and Ang Temba took ropes and left Col with De Camp and his 2 Sherpas from Batard expedition 5th Oct at 3:45 am; Aprin fixed ropes below S Summit and Hillary step. French Sherpas and Ang Temba on top 10:30 am, Aprin 10:40 am and De Camp 11:45 am. Aprin and Ang Temba to C2 same day.

On 7th Oct next summit bid from Col: Lowe and Fuller left Col later than successful climbers and turned back (Lowe not on oxygen to 8100m only, Fuller to 8350-8400m and down because felt lonely, unable to catch up with others). Gibson, Krasnokutsky and Pinzo Sherpa left Col at 5:30 am and were on summit at 2:30 pm, used fixed ropes and moving cautiously with Pinzo carrying extra oxygen for Gibson; she had total of 3 bottles available. Pinzo reaching summit at 12:30 pm? All summiters down to C4 and Lowe and Fuller to C2. Gibson and husband to C2 on 8th and BC 9th Oct.

Strong winds prevented earlier summit success. De Bos to C4 20th to make summit bid but wind too strong to try.

On 29th Muller and De La Ferriere at C4 for summit bid (many others there too from other expeditions) and again winds sent them down next day.

1st Oct 5 members in C4 and also down on 2nd. 

3rd Oct Salino in C4 and on top 4th; left C4 at 9:00 am, 3 hrs after wind stopped, and climbed to left on rock, avoiding deep snow and cornices; on top 2:45 pm. Salino slept in C4 (US's Lowe to C2 direct). Oct 4th summiters ran out of oxygen about S Summit in descent. 

On Oct 6th at C4: Roches (2), Pivots (2), Desez and De Bos, Dorje and Ang Phurba from Rolwaling for summit bid. Annie Pivot waited near S Summit for her husband to go to top; 2 Sherpas also today without oxygen (used it previous night). At S Summit in descent met Korean who died (De Bos gave rucksack with oxygen mask and Bernard Roche gave gloves and Batard's Belgian member and A Pivot). Annie Pivot stayed at C4 that night using oxygen for 1st time; too much wind on 8th and finally down; on 9th and no more attempts.

Both Roches flew from Col at 4:00 pm (not from summit because wind too strong) and arrived at BC by double parapente in 15 minutes.

7th April - all at BC.

8th April - Murphy and Corrigan left in helicopter; Moriarty and Shea left BC and arrived at C1; Falvey and Farrell also.

9th April - Shea and Farrell down with stomach trouble (which plagued teams). Moriarty with Sue Harrington of Evan Smith team crossed ridge and made C2 but got into terrible storm and back to C1; Falvey stayed at C1 [stomach trouble?].

10th April - much snow but these 3 got to C3.

11th April - Falvey and Harrington to BC; Moriarty at C2; Schifrin and Finley and 4 of Bulgarian team also arrived at C2.

12th April - Moriarty, Finley, Schrifin to C3 with 4 of Bol American team with Moriarty in biv sack.

13th April - Route above C3 very little snow; Bol American team went up above C3 but Moriarty and 2 other Americans did not try; had too little supplies for bid and too far from top. Moriarty decided climb finished and was back in BC same day and BC had been cleared that day.

Houchin at this time down to Thami to resupply, snowed in at Thami one day and on down to Namche; also had bronchitis. Back to BC 28th. Farrar had limited time and with snow conditions as they were, he left BC on 28th. On 30th Bowen and Houchin and 2 Nepalese porters moved up to place just south of true site of Dzsampa. Stayed there and on 31st moved loads farther up Nangpa Glacier intending to climb either Messner or normal route. 31st again snowed but moved up on 1st (2 Nepalis, not really capable of handling these conditions and sirdar Kippa Sherpa had disappeared, so only 3 Americans now) to 5660m, just below Nangpa La, after deciding not to try Messner's icefall bad snow conditions. Another 4 inches of snow fell on night of 1st-2nd. On 2nd crosse Nangpa La and spent night at 5660m again, this time where Gyabrag Glacier turns south at ""U""  of Schneider map. Snowed again this night; had been carrying 35 kg loads and Ron's bad back giving trouble. Saw mountain plastered with snow and evidence of avalanching. Stayed there all of 3 April and that evening decided there was too much snow and would not go further. 4th all 3 men down to BC in one day in trail of a yak train. Sent mailrunner to Thami for Yaks on 5th and they were expected 5 days later.

On 28 March, yaks carrying resupply were able to get only 1 hr below BC because of deepness of snow.

Letter from Massimo Sarti - 9 May 1991

The main reason of the unsuccess was insufficient time. As I told you our mission was scientific so that most of our time was dedicated to that. Our attempt to reach the Brikuti base camp through Narsing Khola failed because of our underestimate of logistic requirements such as food supply, unavailability of water, men support and length of the trip. Brikuti is extremely far away if approached from the SW Ridge.

On the other hand, our geologic goals were all accomplished with fantastic and unexpected results.",,,Sherpa Society,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,6131,

(Freidl had been sleeping). They looked, around and saw Karl's body c100m to C3 & very near tent found ice ax with glove in it's strap - Karl's neck broken, but how? Gentle slope with some snow in good condition. He was very strong & professional climber. Perhaps he went up serac above tent, but no sign of body's falling in snow - little blood on temple but only neck broken. Body put on top of closed crevasse which in warmer weather will open. Hans and Friedl then took down to C3 tent and went to C2, took this tent down. Fog coming and going so down slowly in poor visibility. Left some gear below a steep section; others next day would recover this and they towards C1. Their ice axes were singing with & hair full of electricity. 100m above C1 there was a small hill and they were on skies roped together; Friedl asks Hans to wait for better visibility. Hans ear popped but no lightning seen; ear felt like biting on it and he dropped his rucksack and dropped himself into snow - pulled on rope but no response. He scooped out snow and lay in his shallow cave (about 4 pm) but before went to Friedl who did not move, stayed only a minute, made his shelter cave and later again to Freidl and now saw he was dead. Hans immediately to C1 despite snow falling and stayed there above that night - stormed all night. 11 May Hans to BC and 3 other members, sirdar, 2 Sherpas and kitchen boy up to C1.

One had 1 oxygen bottle and one of them moved only 100 vertical meters in 3 hrs while another went up 50m and returned to the other and then both seem going up together. At 4 pm they radioed they were 150m below top, they were cold, one wanted to descend and one wanted to go on up, woman was becoming snowblind but it was she wanting to go up (ambitious to become first woman a top). Both agreed to descend. Last radio contact at 7 pm and reported (speaking with difficulty) they did not know where they were ""lost completely"" or where to find C4; were having trouble pushing radio's buttons. Bodies found on 3rd and 4th; probably fell about 8:00 pm; definitely fell.

Rutkiewicz did not reach summit because she was too slow, spent too much time and energy on photography with much equipment, had no climbing plan. Skarja made no agreement (as she claims he had) to give her 2 summit attempts and after fatal accident climbing finished.

and then learned porters called for 8th at BC, but WR had paid $8800 and received promise to wait for her to make 2 attempts.

Yugos had asked her to help in search/rescue. 

WR to BC to ask someone to help her with obtaining porters when she finished her 2nd attempt. WR started up on 8 May reached C2 - all learned on 8th from BC no staff to wait for her; only 2 porters for one day would wait. Down to BC on 9th, where 2 porters (and ill Ewa) were only people left.

30th April - Stremfelj and Prezelj reached South Summit by new route so planned without oxygen and in one push of 6 days and down normal route to C3 at 7300m on Great Shelf - had made acclimatization climb of Talung.

1 May - Rupar solo ascent to Central Summit from C3 via Polish route without oxygen; started 30 April night; descended same route to C3 on 1 May.

1 May - 2:00 am Bozic and Groselj started from C4 (7600m) to main summit by normal route using oxygen and on top 1:30 pm and down to C3 and 2 May to BC (5500m).

2nd May Frantar and Rozman arrive C4 and 3 May tried for main summit (one on oxygen) at 4:00 pm radioed reached 150m below top and one decided to go down and one up; leader said both should come down (now late and windy) and they agreed and would radio again about 6:30 pm. At 6:30 they reported didn't know, where they were and where to go; Frantar snowblinded and it seemed they had frostbitten fingers. This last contact.

4 May Rutkiewicz alone going up to C4 - 100m below C4 she found Rozman's body battered body must have fallen more than 800m); she returned C3.

5 May Drazan and Juhant up from C3, put Rozman body in crevasse and 50m below C4 found Frantar's body also body battered; put here body in crevasse. Down to C2 and 6 May to BC and expedition finished unless Rutkiewicz tried for top again.

Jannu - tried face in alpine-style from 28 April - reached 7050m in 5 days. Stopped by wind and snow and resounded in 2 days and no additional attempts. Extremely difficult and in daytime sun produced waterfalls.

Others in 18 May KTM; leave 20 May if team arrives as planned.

NE Spur very difficult: snow monsters, ""up-down zig-zag,"" so much fixed ropes. 16 Indian climbing members (Indian leader to C1) and 14 Japanese climbers (Ogata to C6). Northern approach in spring did not reach BC even after digging yak road taking month extra to get to BC.

14 March we left Gangtok by 4 mini-buses and 7 auto trucks with members and high altitude porters.

There are two routes for approaching BC at Green Lake in the Zemu Glacier. One of them is along the Zemu Chu (river) from Lachen and the others are a roundabout way the Northern area from Tanggu. Three high passes stand the roundabout way that Lugnak La, Thieu La and Tangchung La.

The route of our approach to the Base Camp had been set for roundabout way our overall leader. I was anxious about snow condition of these high passes for yaks in middle of March. As a consequence it follows that it took the team 44 days to transport for expedition loads from the road-head to the Base Camp at Green Lake (4935m). If it were not for snow on the high passes, we could reach to Base Camp from road head only 4 days. The advance party arrived the Base Camp on 31 March and last party arrived on 26 April such being the case. 

As advance party selected a site for Advance Base Camp on 1 April. Carrying of supplies up to ABC started on 10 April. The route to ABC led up the Zemu Glacier from Base Camp. ABC was on a glacier where the Twins Glacier joins to the Zemu Glacier at an elevation of 5200m.

After ABC, we started route making for C1. The first obstacle was in the form of an icefall. This icefall stands in just below the Upper Zemu Glacier where it was about one hour from ABC. At that point the East Face of Kangchenjunga, which until then had been hidden by lower part of NE Spur, came into full view for the time. This icefall technically speaking was not as bad as the one of Everest but was far more dangerous due the constant hazard of ice avalanches and falling boulders. The members and high altitude porters had often narrow escapes from the bombardment of stones and ice avalanches.
 
On April 16, 6 climbers who stretched 13 pitches of fixed rope across several crevasses and ice walls. They reached an elevation of 5600m. The next day, they extended the route 9 more pitches up an ice plateau on the Upper Zemu Glacier where we pitched Camp after several days.

On 19th April, both the leader and some members reached C1, we had view for reconnaissance to find a climbing route for East Face of Kangchenjunga. The East Face was very steep with ice and rock mix face and was dangerous due to the constant hazard of big avalanches. We judged from that view there was no feasible route up from the top of the Upper Zemu Glacier.

The same day a huge icefall at the just below the snow plateau broke down and route was cut to pieces. We changed make of fixed rope to the flank of NE Spur on the following day. 

C1 was set up at the South Face of the NE Spur on 20 April at the height of 5700m.

After Camp I we had to gain the crest of the deadly NE Spur. The South Face of the NE Spur rises up almost vertically for about 300m from the flat glacier basin, and the steep face with fluted ice-gullies was swept regularly by avalanches. The route from C1 was traverse of the South Face.

On April 21, Yoshida's party stretched 20 pitches of fixed rope across several ice gullies and broken rock face. They extended the ridge an elevation of 6150m. The next day they extended 2 more pitches up an ice wall, and they came out on the NE Spur. From there the NE Spur that there were towers piled upon towers, cliff upon cliff, huge vertical columns which tapered like spires and shining curtains festooned with icicles, hanging down the precipices from the cornices above. There were great bulges and chasms wrenched by the wind and cold into fantastic mushroom shapes which had the likeness of night monsters. The fixed ropes were flung all over the place to secure the members and high atitude porters from falling into the sheer depths below. We had found old fixed ropes on the ridge presumably belonging to the 1977 and 1987 Indian expeditions. We stretched 34 pitches of fixed ropes from C1 to C2. C2 pitched a strip place the cornices above on the NE Spur an elevation of 6300m on 27 April.

On 28 April, Nazuka's party started route making for C3. From there the NE Spur also there were huge vertical mushroom shapes which had the likeness of monsters. There were cornices which could not be climbed in any way. They passed through a natural tunnels to surmount there. They extended the route 9 pitches up on the rugged ridge from 28 April till 30 April.

On 1st May, Yoshida's party stretched 9 pitches of fixed rope across big crevasses and several huge ice cliffs, and they reached an elevation of 6550m. They extended the route 10 more pitches up on the snow rugged ridge on the following day, and they reached an elevation of 6880m. C3 perched on a snow slope where the 5 pitched below the highest reaching point of the 2 May and elevation of 6800m on 4 May. At that point the NE Spur came into widely snow ridge with no technical difficulty. Below one looks down a steep slope at the Upper Zemu Glacier and the Twins Glacier.

On 4 May we set up C3 at the height of 6800m we had reached the previous day.

On 6 May, Ogata's party reached a point of the NE Spur where there were huge ice cliffs at 7250m. We strung 14 pitches of fixed rope up the snow ridge for two days.

The next day Oda's party succeeded in reaching a point of C4 at the height of 7450m. They strung six and half pitches of fixed rope up the NE Spur. 

On 9 May we established C4, and Nazuka's party stayed the first night at C4. Next morning Nazuka's party started on the route on the NE Spur derived from the Junction Peak and rope were fixed all the way. The route from C4 was up a snow ridge with very steep arete, and this the arete culminating at the highest point the NE Spur. From there the arete below one looks down the North Col on the North Ridge and beyond North Col there is a view of Nepal Himalayas. After four days work to complete this route, 4 Indian climbers reached C5 at the height of 7800m on 14 May. The next day they have set up C5 with two high altitude porters.

On May 15 Pasang Sherpa, Khem Raj, Sharki Bhutia and Lopsang Tshering went for reconnaissance to find a final camp. They reached old camp site of Indian expedition in 1977 and 1987 at height of about 8000m. They returned back to C5. The same day's morning, Sato and I [Ogata] started the labourious work to carry up the luggage to C5 and we reached C5 at noon. We met four Indian members just the same time.

They told us about the ascent route for the summit which can be seen from the reaching highest point on today. I thought that they have caught an easy going way of thinking for attack to the summit.

The next day they had thunder clap of accident. They made a start from C5 at just 4:00 am. Four Indians members reached to the old camp site of Indian expedition, they deposited their carrying loads at the place, and continued up the summit of Kangchenjunga at their own discretion with one oxygen cylinder to each of the members.

During their attack Pasang Sherpa tragically fell off to the North Face side and was missing.
Though the accident upset the plan considerably, I have made again plan for attack to the summit.

We went into mourning for Pasang Sherpa at each camp on following day. We regained the final stage of our expedition with heavy hearts.

On 23 May, seven Japanese members who were constituted into a support party and on 24 May the summit party, they went up to the North Face, and reached an elevation of 7950m on the North Face. They established C6 at this point, and now they were getting the full blast of the westerlies. Nazuka and Imamura stretched 7 pitches of fixed rope in the snow gully at the rear of C6. The support party returned, leaving Hideji Nazuka, Hirotaka Imamura and Ryuzo Oda at C6. When they tried to fix their oxygen regulators they found that there were two sets only. We discussed the best attack plan by walkie-talkie between C6 and BC, and we decided that Nazuka attempt an attack of the summit without oxygen.

On 24th May, they made a start at just 4:00 am in biting cold. Oda was carrying two oxygen cylinders and Imamura was carrying one oxygen cylinder they started climbing. They added another 3 pitches of fixed rope for safety on the descent. Very soon Imamura collapsed owing to the some trouble on the oxygen mask that Imamura was not getting any oxygen flow. He left his oxygen cylinder and he began climbing again without oxygen. At 8:15 am Oda left one of his half used oxygen cylinder to be used on the return journey. They slogged on and on, in deep snow and fierce winds. Sometimes the winds were so strong that they were pushed of their feet. At 10:57 am Nazuka reached the West Col on the main ridge of between Main Peak and Yalung Kang (West Peak). From there the summit ridge of Kangchenjunga becomes traversed a snow and rock mix face the Yalung glacier side, he escaped to some partly fierce winds. He climbed along the Yalung Glacier side of the summit ridge to the main summit. It was 11:50 am when Nazuka stood on the summit of Kangchenjunga. He remembered the promise the team had given to the people of Sikkim. He left the last 7 feet untrodden. He took pictures and came back the same way he went in carefully, and he returned back the West Col at 13:00 and then he met Oda. Imamura had not yet reached the Col. Imamura reached the West Col climbing up the summit ridge. Very soon Imamura joined Oda. They finally stood up on the summit at 15:23, and returned back C6 in darkness at 22:30 in the night.

Next early morning the second summit party, consisting of Coy Commander SD Sharma, Subedar Kanhaiya Lal and Sub-Inspector T Smamla started from C6 to summit. They reached the summit of Kangchenjunga at 14:30 and returned back Camp 6 in safety at 19:48.

Because of the time and weather constraints most of the members both Japanese and Indians had to sacrifice their chance to summit the peak as to support their colleagues in the best mountaineering tradition. Thus six members could reach the summit.",Nothing except Pasang's fatal fall; Ogata fell 20m but not hurt,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2454577,

Now decided not to continue climbing because expected permit not granted. Permit was actually granted (French ambassador was so informed) but Sonam of Thamserku Tkg and Ang Tshering of Sherpa Society gave a lot of money ($5000+) to Sachit Pant, a Tourism Ministry official, to induce him not to give written permission.

Will not try to climb again in Nepal. Will concentrate upon Alps and spend more time with his children and will make training film about climbing. For his group for Everest for Autumn 1991: will suggest Pakistan or S America. ""I have climbed Everest twice and I am happy"" and has no more patience with Nepalese. On his return to France, he will inform authorities about 2 members of Sonam-Ang Tshering family working there illegally and (left BC 5th May) discuss with French trek organizers from using these agencies. Sonam and Ang Tshering are brothers; another brother Tendi works with Ang Tshering and he sent Batard a fax in France saying that if Batard did not employ their agency to represent him, he would not get his permit for Everest this spring.


Miss Marie-Annick - 4 July 1991

French ambassador was told on phone by tourism secretary that Batard would be granted Everest permit this spring. Batard had already left KTM for Khumbu but Maurice Uguen was still in town pressing for permit. Neither ambassador nor she talked in ministry.


Bikram Pandey - 26 June 1991

Trying till 28 June to get permit for Batard for autumn 1991. Pandey asked Batard to let him try for permit and Batard agreed recently but asked for outcome very soon.


4 July 1991 - HMG has formed committee and their attitude is not very favorable, so telling Batard today [chances] for permit are not good.


Ang Tshering (Sherpa Society) - 25 June 1991

HMG has formed a committee of Tourism and Immigration officials to investigate Batard's activities. Fear his statements in France can harm flow of French tourists to Nepal - this is Tourism minister's ideas.


Sachit Pant, Tourism Ministry - 9 May 1991

Batard will not get permission for Everest for this spring, and permit he already had for autumn 1991 has been suspended and its restoration uncertain.

Batard's photographer Maurice Uguen in April met and photographed Prime Minister Bhattarai and Ganesh Man Singh and spoke with both about pending spring permit. About 9 trekking agents informally met with PM who asked if they wanted charges of bribery of Tourism Ministry officials to go to Special Police Dept - they said they did not. Still, if Tourism gave permit when application had been filed only in April, bribery charges would become loud and clear.

Autumn permit suspended after charges of Batard's beating Sonam Sherpa's wife (Pasang Lhamu) last autumn.


Chris Hawthorne, Australian Everest - 8 May 1991

Batard left BC early morning and got above C3 on Lhotse Face but got blown down to BC - about 1 May.
Waiting for permit to make another try.
Maurice and doctor at BC - other climber.


Bikram Pandey, Amtrek - 2 May 1991
Batard Everest:

Sonam's letter of no objection applies to autumn 1991 not this spring. Sachit Pant of Tourism learned that Joint Secretary Pradhan had agreed orally to give Batard permit and immediately objected, raising possibility of bribery. There was a charge against Batard of ""man-handling"" Sonam's wife (Pasang Lhamu) as well as not allowing her to try for Everest summit last autumn.


Pandey - 14 May 1991

Joint Secretary actually put his full signature on Batard's application, giving permission, but Pant refused to let permit be typed out, told Secy that Sherpas would protest to the Secy and Pant could not be responsible for consequences; so Secretary held Batard file.


Batard - 22 April 1991

Tourism Ministry official to Bhola Rana of problem now about Batard's permit for Everest and Lhotse for this spring is that there is an allegation that he has been getting a lot of permits in recent years without waiting by bribing a tourism official who now is Joint Secretary in Tourism.

Here technically difficult at W Ridge. Down to C3 on 16th and 3 of them to BC on 17th while Parmentier stayed in C3 with plan to solo to top in good weather. From 17th to 24th snow fall daily and very cold and windy (constant snow). Parmentier 17-18th in C3, 19th up and pitched small tent at 8200m, 20th up in Hornbein's deep snow. At 1 pm his track seen to 8400m, then cloudy and no further contact on sighting (21st briefly clear and even track not seen). 

22nd up from BC Chamoux, Campredon and Rakoncaj in 3rd summit bid and C1 very windy and down to BC next day and climb finished. Last members on mountain left Chinese BC 27th. Snowfall had brought avalanche danger (which probably took Parmentier).

Profit and Kammerlander started from BC 10 and 12 May to C3 on 13th for summit push on 15th. Profit in early May had done to traverse left from C3 with Hajzer and they reached to Polish route. On 13th night snowfall began and Profit and Kammerlander down to BC. Now every day fell.

2 Poles [Hajzer and Wielicki] started from BC on 12 May up Polish route, carrying all gear and did approx 500m/day and in 4 days reached 7100m on this route but now weather stopped them, did risky traverse to C3, where slept night of 16th and to BC on 17th.

Spring 2000:

1999 Slovenian Dhaulagiri I expedition and Slovenian Lhotse expedition of Spr 2000 said Cesen's claim to Jannu summit is doubted since his Lhotse South Face claim totally discredited. 

Australian-New Zealand Jannu leader and other member 5th June said: They don't believe Cesen's claim because he had not enough acclimatization and time he gives for his ascent is not enough. In his report to AAJ, Cesen skims over many important details, especially very steep rock from 6900-7500m, which is very difficult technically.


Jannu - Spring 1989 by Tomo Cesen

For almost a year before setting out, my mind had been totally preoccupied with thoughts of Jannu. After all, its North Face is one of the most difficult in the world.

We established BC on 22nd April, at 4600m at the edge of the Khumbakarna glacier. The following day after breakfast, Jani and I approached the foot of the face. Its upper part was always clearly visible from BC, but the lower part presented a puzzle which I wanted to solve as soon as possible. The start of my route didn't look too encouraging. The face started with an icefall which, from our side of the glacier, looked like a mound of ice cubes threatening to collapse at any moment. I was, however more interested in the upper part of the face, where the eye was drawn to ice gullies and smooth, overhanging granite walls, interspersed with giant roofs - a fantastic sight. It soon became clear to me that I would need to change my initial strategy for tackling this upper part of the face but I knew before I left that it would be practically impossible to plan an exact route. The threat from falling seracs or from avalanches was not too great but the whistling of ice blocks and rocks provided convincing proof that the face was extremely dangerous. Most of this ammunition funnelled into couloir at the bottom of the middle part of the face. I needed little convincing to climb this section at night.

At dawn on the 27th April I was not over enthusiastic about the weather. It was cloudy. However, I still had half a day to prepare my equipment. We were having lunch when the sun rays eventually pierced the clouds. Its interesting how quickly one's mood can change. Around midday I left with Jani, who wanted to accompany me to the start of the glacier. The weather was fantastic and my mood matched it, but I was aware that the waiting would be hard for Jani, perhaps more difficult in some ways that what I was setting out on.

Alone on the glacier I felt a sense of exhilaration. This was good sign that I was already in control. I hung the pitons and a spare blade for the ice axe on my harness, put crampons on my feet and took the ice axes in my hands. I took some rope and of course a helmet but my rucksack contained only spare clothing, gloves, glasses, food and drink, sleeping bag and a biv sac; not much gear. I mused that to climb the North Face of Jannu in this way would be, if nothing else, a challenge.

After some 200m of initial warming up I came to the first ten-metre section of vertical ice. Four hours later the easier, lower part of the face was behind me so I took a ten minute rest. The valley below was already in darkness, but up here the light was still good despite the late hour. Thankfully the steady barrage of falling rock and ice began to ease off. Climbing this section of the face during the day would have been suicidal, but with the night came safety. The next 200 metres or so were very difficult; cramponing up a 70 to 75-degree couloir, sometimes on rock, sometimes on ice. At that point it slowly began to dawn on me what might be waiting above.

The new day came as I reached the end of the ice field. From here I had to move right to the next ice field which was separated from a final one by the first really problematic part of the route. Very steep ice and smooth granite slabs followed one after the other. I used the seracs at the beginning of the middle ice field to orientate myself on the face. There would be no possibility of protection as there were no cracks at all in the rock. I was glad to finally reach steep ice gully which led to the less steep ice field below some huge seracs, where I could take my next short rest.

A short rock step separated me from the final part of the face. Ice, rock, ice again followed by more granite slabs. The exit from this particular section was something special. A gently sloping slab barred the way to the last ice field and the vertical exit from the face. Without crampons and gloves, and some 6000 metres lower this would have been quite easy, but here it was another matter. I couldn't remove my crampons and besides, double plastic boots are not best suited to friction climbing. For a while I leaned unhappily with my hands on the slab and my crampons dug into the thin ice below. In order to gain better support for the tip of my crampons I carefully chipped at some smal crystals of ice with my axe. Everything went very slowly. I can hardly describe the feeling of relief at the top of the slab when my ice axe at last hit ice. Definitely not a pitch for the faint-hearted. For a while I stared upwards and took in an unbelievable view. Now at 7000m, I fully  realised what lay in store for me. This was the time to draw on those psychological reserves that I had trained for. There was no way back.

Above lay a vertical gully lined with thin ice, sometimes interspersed with a few metres of bare rock. The rock appeared good, although I didn't relish the prospect of climbing it in crampons.

The world around me receded. I became lost in total concentration: body and mind focussed; strength and balance pushed to the limit.

Now facing me was a series of near vertical granite slabs, each 30 to 40 metres high and covered with a 10 centimetre veneer of ice. In the thin air I couldn't climb these slabs without rest, and best described as hanging on my ice axe - was not pleasant. There were at least ten of these giant ice covered steps on this part of the face. The problem was that there were some easier options but they were not visible from below. This meant that I could only guess at the best route upwards. I was forced to use pitons on four occasions, but in the wide cracks I just had to climb free in crampons. There was either not enough space to remove them, or it would have been too dangerous. Fortunately the cracks sometimes allowed me to jam in a boot, relax the tension in my arms and take a short rest.

At the end of the rock there was always ice: hard black, green sometimes crumbling, but always very steep. At one point I had to pendulum a narrow ice gully had lost itself in blank granite slabs, with vertical rock above, left and right. I noticed a tiny crack above me and climbed slowly and carefully almost to the tip of this fragile ice tongue, taking care not to break it. I hammered in a piton, threaded the rope, descended a litte and started to swing, thus managing to reach the continuation of the gully to the left.

I was slowly approaching the summit ridge, despite extremely difficult sections which dogged my steps right to the last moment. Suddenly the end came as I almost stumbled onto the soft snow of the ridge. Although the summit of Jannu was very close, and the ridge leading to it presented no difficulties, I felt drained and told myself and told myself I had enough of this kind of torture. The weather, meanwhile, was deteriorating and it was 3:30 pm before I reached the top. To the south was a grey sea of cloud. The weather usually worsens in the afternoons so I needed to descend as far as quickly as possible.

A proper storm was gathering as I roped down onto the upper ice field of the Japanese route. I did not want to sit out in the middle of the a 55-60 degree ice field, but the heavy snowfall and strong cold winds soon forced me to seek temporary safety in a crevasse among the seracs.

That endless biv was one of chattering teeth and quivering muscles: of constant checking my watch and hoping that the weather pattern of the last few days would prevail. Howling winds swept snowflakes in all directions: fog, darkness.

In the middle of the night the storm finally began to abate so I decided to continue down immediately. From the crevasse I descended among the seracs for about 100m. It was the wrong way. To continue meant tackling a 15m vertical ice wall. I could not face retracing my steps, so I had no choice but to chisel an ice mushroom on the lip of the serac and abseil. In daylight I might have sought a better route but in the darkness I took the most direct line. Among the lower seracs I zig-zagged left and right in order to stay among them for as long as possible, and on the final section to the plateau I used the rope a few more times.

The ice fall in the jumbled mess of the Khumbakarna Glacier was a mere formality. I chose a much easier route than for my ascent, albeit a more dangerous one, but I told myself that if the seracs hadn't collapsed for a whole week, they'd last another hour or two. Then it was over. There was no more danger. The way ahead was easier. My concentration lapsed. My walk across the glacier resembled the walk of a drunk returning home from a night out.

Half way from BC Jani met me, smiling broadly. It had taken me 5 hours to reach BC from the foot of the face, where normally it would have taken just two. I was exhausted. After three days of great effort and with only a little food, my stomach was not ready for solids, so that afternoon we had a liquid feast and some of us suffered as a result - but that another story.

Some people considered that the North Face Jannu could not be climbed in the way I chose, what I was more confident than most that I would succeed. However, Jannu is only a part of what I believe in.


Tomaz Humar - 7 Nov 2006

Tomaz Humar's comments about Tomo Cesen's claimed ascent via the South Face: ""It is possible Tomo did make the summit.... I don't say he did, but I don't say he didn't."" When people can't do something themselves, they say no one can. Humar has seen the South Face, and he thinks Cesen could have gone all the way to the top alone. He was a very strong climber. Lhotse's South Face is not so difficult as Jannu's North Face, which Cesen also said he soloed. Humar also has seen Jannu's North Face and thinks it is possible that he summited. Tomaz also believes that the Jannu face is more difficult because of the greater danger of falling rock on the face.

At the end of the rock there was always ice: hard black, green sometimes crumbling, but always very steep. At one point I had to pendulum a narrow ice gully had lost itself in blank granite slabs, with vertical rock above me and climed slowly and carefully almost to the tip of this fragile ice tongue, taking care not to break it. I hammered in a piton, threaded the rope, descended a little and started to swing, thus managing to reach the continuation of the ice gully to the left.

I was slowly approaching the summit ridge, despite extremely difficult sections which dogged my steps right to the last moment. Suddenly the end came as I almosst stumbled onto the soft snow of the ridge. Although the summit of Jannu was very close, and the ridge leading to it presented no technical difficulties. I felt drained and told myself I'd had enough of this kind of torture. The weather, meanwhile, was deteriorating and it was 3:30 p.m before I reached the top. To the south was a grey sea of cloud.

Total: 10 traversed and had already been to one summit before = 50 summits
Total: 85 summits by all 22 mountain climbers, 3 film group members, deputy leader Cherny and coach Efimov, and one Sherpa.

No accidents or frostbite; 1 case of altitude sickness during descent without oxygen but no serious effects.

Only 3 Sherpas went above C3 but 15 to C3 - members did much load carrying.

Lower part of route not normal way: arrived in snowstorm and couldn't see well. ""Weather was so good for us, but winds so bad up high"" in April.

We climbed the SW Ridge. Through a series of events, we ended at a base camp on the west side of Kalapatar, and so may have pioneered a new route on the first 2000 ft. From base camp we worked around the right of the triangular glacier and up a thousand vertical feet to the Kalapattar ridge through sections of rock and 60-degree to 70-degree ice. C1 was placed on April 7 at 19,600 ft on the first bit of flat ground. The route was unusually dry this season. We encountered mostly loose rock and mushroom ice between C1 and C2. The latter was occupied on April 13 at 20,400 ft. We intersected the regular route there. We traversed under rock towers through very loose rock and along sun-cupped ice and water ice before moving vertically onto better rock back to the ridge. We placed C3 at 21,500 ft on April 23. The route was littered with old fixed rope and hardware, some of which we cleaned. On April 25, Lucy Smith, Carol Snetsinger and Kathy Phibbs summited. Three days later, Diane Taliaferro and I also reached the summit.

Canadians and Italians took turns leading climb, 1 day Canada next day Italy. From top of Pillar sat out a day of bad storm and Italians then decided to go down because of lack of food and fuel and weather conditions while 2 Canadians stayed but were now on half rations. 16 May good weather.

Dhaulagiri Trilogy by Jiri Novak from Mountain Magazine, July/Aug 1988

Three months before departure my big chance came. Some key people in the expedition couldn't make it and I was made leader of what had become a ""super light"" team of eight climbers and two trekkers.

On 16th Sept a cosmopolitan group arrived at the green field beneath the West Face. Myself, Igor Novak, Tomas Skricka (the expedition doctor), and Zoltan Demjan were from Czechoslovakia; Marco Fogliatti and Sergio Antoniazzi from Italy and Jurij Mojsejev and Kazbek Valijec from the Soviet Union.

We had come to finish off the French Pillar to the summit, and attempt the Japanese Route on the South Face, but yet again the monsoon stayed late and bad was pushing us up against our deadline for leavinag on Oct 12.

The first good break came on Sept 25th, and next day a team set out for the SW Saddle at 5100m and the day after that, a start was made on the Japanese Pillar. The latter team soon came up against acclimatization problems, and were forced to abandon their climb.

The climbers on the SW Pillar, however were fresha and fit from climbing in the Tien Shan, prior to departure for Nepal, and on Sept 28th, Zoltan Demjan, Jurij Mojsejev and Kazbek Valijev left the SW Saddle, carrying only 15 kg loads each.

Five bivouacs and 1700m of climbing got them to within striking distance of the summit, and on 6 Oct at 19:15 all three climbers reached the top. Descending the way they came the team reached BC on Oct the 11th after sixteen days of climbing!

For Zoltan Demjan, it was his third ""eight thousander."" He describes his experience:

""We were late in starting the ridge and the climbing was immediately difficult, forcing us to climb without mittens. In some places the metamorphised limestone was solid, in others it was crushed. The possibilities for hooking were good and some pitches were as magnificient as on Yosemite granite!

I did most of the leading, particularly the difficult pitches, but the big problem was with fierce gust of wind, blowing up the face, one of which nearly swept Kazbek Valijev away. The 600m headwall of the Pillar was the crux. In three days we climbed 16 rope lengths of alpine VI and A2.

The last 70 metres of the pillar I climbed in the dark, with the light of my headtorch gleaming in the clear water ice. We had only one rucksack with two sleeping bags, gas, two climbing ropes and one thin 80m rope.

On the bivouac above the pillar, my toes became frozen, but the hard climbing was below us, and there ""only"" remainded the three km ridge to the summit.

On 6th October at 7 pm we reached the summit and stayed there for 15 minutes, but I was so exhausted, I couldn't even summon the energy to film or photograph the others. Thankfully, Kazbek Valijev planted a small Kazakh flag in the summit pyramid to mark our passing.

The descent in the dark was unnerving. Would we find our bivouac? Would the weather hold? The others kept my spirits up, with their good humoured banter, but I was desperately hungry. Sometimes I could ago for two days without food, but not here. After all the leading, I was drained, so Kazbek and Jurij really looked after me, and got food into me quickly at the top bivouac.

The summit photograph would have to wait till BC, but not to worry. We were tired, wasted, but alive.""",None except Foglaiti intestinal illness,,Everest Adventure,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453389,

But unfortunately, the team ventured to do climbing suffered of great damages of 2000 kg materials by fire because of the mistakes of the employees on the way of caravan. They started with the thinking of burden, should finish quickly the climbing, because the foods and equipments are in short.

They established BC at 4700m on Oct 25th. Japanese team had been already evacuated. The day after leading party Ryu Il-Keun and Choi Tae-Sik rushed to C1 with two Sherpas. Fixed rope in 800m rock step and 150m snow plastered. At first, they followed previous party's (Japanese party) route. But the route turned out dangerous and then decided to changing route in order to avoid the avalanche.

On Oct 27th, they established C1 at 5800m and they found the foods and equipment left by Japanese team near the C2.

Although the bad weather they set up C2 and C3 6620m and 7400m.

It was more worse afer making the C4 at 7800m on Nov 5th. Ryu was confined alone at C4 because of traditionally poor Dhaulagiri weather - deep snow. Wind was strong and temperature dropped to -40 degrees C. 

In spite of bad weather Ryu and Seo Sung-Soo had left C4 toward the summit on Nov 7th but they had to stop the below the Rock Band in deteriorating weather. All members forced descended to BC.

On Nov 14th Choi and two Sherpas had left C4 for the summit at 09:00. After more than six hours of climbing they encountered the three peaks at 8160m. That was the last obstacle below the summit and finally they reached the top at 16:00.

They climbed slowly down to C4 but became to dark and they had to bivouacked below the rock band at 8050m without sleeping bag or stove. Choi had suffered frostbite.

Ryu and two Sherpas who waited for the second attack at C4 descended to BC escorting the first attack party. The team was given up the 2nd attempt because of bad weather and a lack of food. All members descended to BC at 22:00 on Nov 24th.

They used no artificial oxygen for climbing on Nov 16. Tukuche party Park Yuk-Kwang, Lee Sang-Hoon and Jeon Jae-Yong stood on the top of Tukuche northwest peak.

The team failed ""the long traverse"" but succeeded on the climbing of two peaks.

Dhaulagiri VI and Gurja, Aut 1988 by Young Cheol Shin

Several Korean climbers from Wulsan (leader; Mr Young-Cheol Shin) planned a joint expedition with Nepali climbers with a great ambition of conquering simultaneously 2 peaks above 7000m - Dhaulagiri VI (7268m) and Gurja Himal (7193m).

The first attack began on Sept 26th at 5:52 am, Mr. Bong-Hee Nam (climbing leader) and Nepali member Ang Pasang started C4 (6750m) for Dhaulagiri VI, and at the same for Gurja Himal, Sang-Ho Lee and Seung-Hwan Lee, and the same time for Gurja Himal, Sang-Ho Lee and Seung-Hwan Lee (Korean), and Pemba (Nepali) also started.

The climbing route toward Dhaulagiri VI was led 300m down from C4 and then continued to knife ridge. Climbing carefully through very sharp and dangerous ridge, member Nam and Ang Pasang firstly gained the summit. It was 12:30 pm. Just after 13 minutes, another success was performed on the top of Gurja Himal.

As the second attempt, member Sang-Ho Lee and Seung-Hwan Lee again got to the summit of Dhaulagiri VI at 12:15 pm on Sept 27th.",None,1st Korean ascent in 1st attempt,Adventure Nepal,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453379,

So late on top meant they had to spend night at or near top because route there too difficult to descend at night even with headlamps. Was windy and very cold so biv must have been exhausting.

Letter from Malcolm Duff - 11 Nov 1988 

You may well have heard that our cook died of HAPE at 13,500 ft on the walk-in. The first party suffered appalling conditions and at this spot decided to send down 14 porters who were likely to die from exposure. 8 other porters (superstars) were pitted out in expedition equipment and stayed in the group to help in the final 1-day ferry to BC.

The previous section of the route in is absolutely desperate (2 loads were dropped into a gorge directly below). Clearly evacuating of anybody by land is out of the question.

They had established BC on 10th (or at least some gear got there) when the cook who had responded to treatment by drugs, suddenly became worse and died approx midnight.",Cook died on approach to BC,,Rover Treks,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453386,

Upper part of route along ridge from south of summit was very difficult: very sharp ridge, several steps of technical difficulty and windy.

All descended E Ridge route. C2A and C3A made via Glacier Dome: C2A 6760m on 30th Sept and C3A 7150m on 1 Oct at foot of Roc Noir.

""Weather: very strong ice wind, low temperature on bad ice, snow""; 60-degree ice walls from C2, 1st biv to C2 mostly fixed rope with grade 3 in some places, grade 4 in one place (with rock covered by loose snow), 15 pitches from C2 and 1st biv on icewall. Above 1st biv climbed together in hurry up 200-300m gully step to big snowfield. Ridge to 2nd biv which became C4A for other route. Route even to C1 very exiting: grade 4 rock back and icefall below C1 with 400m fixed rope which had to be replaced often. Did not go to main summit because had been to it in 1987 and more importantly were afraid of heavy clouds moving in. -26 degrees in tent at 2nd biv and strong winds, so decided to skip main summit and descend.

2nd route (4 camps) via Glacier Dome: 15 Oct from C3A Navarette, Espinoza and Majer up to Kukuczka and Hajzer's 2nd biv = C4A. 16 Oct 2 pm Navarette to East Summit of Annapurna I, Majer stopped 10m below summit because strong cold wind. Espinoza stopped 100-200m because altitude affecting him (altitude exhaustion). Same evening to C4A all 3 men and next evening to C3A in fog. Near top of Roc Noir descended slightly more direct way; in this section were very big cornices and one broke and Navarette fell (he was Ecuador's No 1 mountaineer). Majer and Espinoza down rock face, Espinoza fell 100m and lost gloves, so fingers frozen (also nose). Navarette fell from about 7450m and disappeared 4:00-5:00 pm. Espinoza fell from about 7200m at 6:00 pm. Espinoza and Majer did not find C3A till next morning and stayed there 1 night. Todd up from C2 18th: scaled Glacier Dome and later that day BC radioed to him to search for 3 missing men and he found 2; to C2 in 1 day and ABC in another day 20th. Espinoza was comotose when Todd met them. Left BC 22nd.

Dr. Korniszewski: Espinoza will lose top half of right thumb from frostbite. After he learned of Navarrete's fatal fall, he became paralyzed in his legs, had to be carried from Chamro most of the time to Surkhet, although few hours each day could walk slowly with 2 poles (sticks): psychological cause.


Expedition Round Up Expeditions 1988 - from Himalaya Club Newsletter 

Annapurna South face, 1988: Our expedition was organized by the High Mountain Club of Katowice and led by Jerzy Kukuczka. We reached the base camp on 30th Aug on the right morraine of the Annapurna Glacier. On the 2nd Sept advance BC was placed at 5200m. Two days later C1 (5800m) was established in a small basin between the slopes of Annapurna, Roc Noir and Glacier Dome. The route to this camp led by dangerous icefalls and very dangerous corridor between the glacier and rocks. On 12 sept C2 (6550m) was made on the lower part of the far east spur of the Annapurna South Face. On 11 Oct Hajzer and Kukuczka started from C2. They climbed via the nearly 2000m high spur mostly through 60-degree ice grooves. 15 pitches or so need careful rope protection. Climbing alpine-style, they made the bivvy at 7100m. Next day the difficulties of ice continued but in the upper part of the rib the ground became less severe. The pair reached the Annapurna East Ridge half way between the Roc Noir and Annapurna East. They bivouacked at 7500m where a tent was placed. On 13 Oct, 1988, the summit of Annapurna I East (8010m) was reached. Bad weather conditions thwarted the plan to continue the climb towards main summit. Hajzer and Kukuczka descended to the 7500m bivvy and spent the night there. On 14 Oct they continued the descent via the slopes of Roc Noir and Glacier Dome (7193m) and bivouacked once again at 6800m. Next day the base camp was reached.

The second team consisted of Espinoza, Navarrete and Majer who took a much easier variation.  On 15 Oct they reached the tent at 7500m and next day left for the summit. At 2 pm Navarette gained the top and in spite of wind and cold spent there about 10 minutes. I didn't reach the very top and waited for him a few meters below it. Espinoza had to give up some 200m before the summit. We descended to our tent and slept there. Next day (17 October) the weather was bad with strong wind and mist. Descending the east ridge we had route finding difficulties. In the area of the sharp ridge of Roc Noir, Navarrette disappeared, probably falling through a cornice. Lack of visibility prevented us from a search. Beneath Roc Noir Espinoza fell some 100m but survived. The night from 17 to 18 we spent both in snow caves without equipment. In the morning the tent at 7200m was reached and base camp informed about the fatal accident. A rescue team including Steve Untch helped the exhausted pair and went in quest of Navarette, unfortunately, in vain. The base camp was left on 22 Oct.

Ramiro Navarrette (39) had very good seasons in South America and belonged to the best mountaineers of his country. In Sept 1987 he climbed the Shishapangma (8027m).",Espinoza fingers frostbitten and temporary leg paralysis after fall; Navarrete fatal fall,Climbed Glacier Dome en route to Annapurna East Summit,Asian Trekking,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453396,ASTREK

On 20th he got up at 4:00 am and went to C1 to have a look, arrived at C1 expecting find them there but no sign of them there or above on route and did same on 21st. ""No doubt bodies are in bergschrund."" On 21st also walked around under SE Face to look. Not feasible for him to climb above C1 because of crevasses. Pair must have fallen roped together. Aisthorpe's highest point was about 6000m at top of fixed ropes. No chance others reached summit because route above serac clearly visible from BC (could well have been behind it an hour and then emerged back into view). Highest possible point for them to have reached without having been seen would be 6550m.

Australian Jeffery Williams reported seeing pair on summit afternoon of Oct 19 (AAJ).


Report Searching the Body

Four of us started to searching the bodies on 5th June. We arrived in Lobuje and spend over night there. The next morning we started at 7am and arrived at Gorakshep within 1 and 1/2 hours. We set our camp at Gorakshep and make a day tour all around the icefall and crampons. We were searching there for couple of days. Our detail route as given with a rough map.

Well first of all we had been to base camp and looking all around the ice fall, same day we climbed Kalapattar. The day was clear so we have had good view of both side of mtns and due icefall and crampons, but there is no sign of bodies, so we came back to camp that day.

Next day we had been climbing the black rock which is more higher.


Accident Report Anglo-Icelandic Pumori Expedition 1988

The Anglo-Icelandic Pumori Expedition established a base camp at west of Kalapattar, the site used by the 1986 New Zealand Expedition.

From 4th to 13th Oct, members established and carried loads to a high camp at approx. 5800m on the Upper Changri Shar Glacier. We also fixed about 400m of rope on steep ice and mixed ground on the West Face. Porsteinn, Gudjonnson, Kristinn Runarsson and Steve Aisthorpe all spent two nights at the high camp and two days fixing ropes.

On 4th October Jon Giersson had begun to develop pains in the chest and now, after talking with doctors at the Himalayan Rescue Association post in Pheriche, he decided to return to Paris. He left base camp on 14th Oct and we all spent the night together with Porsteinn. I began to develop sysmtoms of gastric flu. On 16th Oct I descended to Pheriche to speak to the doctor about this. As the doctor suggested that it would be 4-7 days before I would recover. I sent a message with Ang Nuru, our sirdar, suggesting that Porsteinn and Kristinn should continue climbing without me

On receiving this message on the morning of the 17th Oct, they left base camp at 10 am with intention of going to high camp that day, leaving the camp at midnight, ascending the fixed ropes, climbing together up ice to reach the SW Ridge at about 6700m, bivouacing there, then going for the summit on the 19th, then descending the West Face by asceil. The took from the high camp 2100 ropes, 10 screws, 6 gas cylinders, sleeping bags, down clothing, bivi bags and food.

On 18th Oct, while I was still in Pheriche recovering from gastric flu, Ang Nuru and Phu Dorje, watched Porsteinn and Kristinn through a camera with a telephone lens. They made steady program and were moving together. They were last seen at about 2 pm, when they disappeared from view behind a serac at about 6400m. They did not reappear into view the that day.

I arrived in base camp at about 8 am on 19th Oct and waited expectantly for the two figures to appear on the ridge and climbed to the summit. Nobody appeared from above the serac that day.

On 20th Oct I left base camp at 4:30 am and climbed to the high camp. There was however no sign of them in high camp. From the C1 I had clear view of the route, but there was not sign of life. I went back to base camp and went, in the afternoon, with Ang Nuru around to below the SE Face, but there was nothing to see on the afternoon of 20th Oct. I sent a message to the officer in charge at Namche Bazar police post requesting that he radio the following message to Kathmandu; ""To Mountain Travel. Please send helicopter to Gorak Shep immediately - 2 members missing."" On 21st Oct I woke at 4 am and again climbed to the high camp. I searched the Upper Changri Shar Glacier as far as possible, but found nothing. I then descended to Gorak Shep and waited for a helicopter. I also spent the 22nd Oct, waiting in Gorak Shep for a helicopter. When it didn't arrive I sent our Liaison Officer, Mr Bal Krishna Shrestha, with the same message as before to Namche Bazar. I spent 23rd Oct waiting expectantly for the helicopter in Gorak Shep. On 24th Oct at 11 am a helicopter arrived in Gorak Shep. The pilot explained that the reason for the delay was that there was a policy of not making helicopters available for searching - only for rescue.

After some persuasion, the pilot took me on a search above the Changri Shar Glacier and spiralled up the West Face to about 6000m. We could not safely climb any higher. I could see no traces of Porsteinn, Kristinn or their equipment.

It seemed certain that they had fallen from about 6500m on 18th Oct and that there bodies now lay in the complex bergschrund at the foot of the face. As I was the only remaining climber in the area and none of the our base camp Sherpas were equipped or experienced enough to venture serious risk to my own life. The crevasses on the Upper Changri Shar Glacier had opened up considerably during the last week and for me to move around on the glacier after the sun had begun to soften the snow bridges was very dangerous. After six very cold nights and a small snowfall, it seemed certain that any searching was for bodies only and, as such, further searches by myself seemed unjustifiable.

I returned to Kathmandu with the helicopter and tried to contact Jon Giersson and Anna Lara Fredrickdottir from the Mountain Travel Office. Eventually, at about 10 pm local time I spoke with Bjorn, Anna's husband and President of the Icelandic Alpine Club. I gave as much information as possible about what had happened to Porsteinn and Kristinn. On 25th Oct I spoke with Kristinn's father on the telephone and related the above incidents in as much detail as possible. In my opinion Porsteinn and Kristinn died on 18th Oct as a result of a fall down the steep rock and ice of the West Face of Pumori. Their bodies lie in the bergschrund at the foot of the face.

Expedition Report/Gyachung Kang (7952m) by Hwa-Seok Yang
Taken from Sanak in winter 1988

Daejeon Seil Club, the first summiter to Ngojumba Kang in 1982, again made a great achievement on SW Face of Gyachung Kang this time. 

On Oct 2nd they advanced to C2 for 5 days and on 12th, C2 was secured at the foot of the Gyachung Kang Face.

Suddenly on Oct 17th, they saw a unfortunate Japanese climber falling down in his way of returning from SW Ridge leaving to the summit just 50m and they continued climbing with more indomitable spirit, so that they overcame the difficult route to fix the ropes. Especially toward C4, they had to climb up almost vertical face mixed with rock, snow and ice, which needed more time than expected. Consequently they could not find any suitable place for their camp after dark, and it was over 8:00 pm when they barely managed to sleep just in one tent blocked with ice. It was Oct 22. C4 was established at 7500m the next day.

On Oct 24th, member Yeon Heon-Mo and Shim Yeom-Bo started for the summit with Ang Rinji and Ang Dorji. After overcoming the mixed route with ice and snow (over 100m long), they arrived at the point connected from West Ridge to the summit. Due to very steep rock slope just below the summit, they had to make a detour of long and exhausted advances in the direction of Tibet, and after 5 hours and 20 minutes of struggles they finally reached the summit.",None,1st autumn ascent in 1st Korean attempt,Asian Trekking,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2453407,ASTREK

Joined French Spring 1986 route only at 7200m because of crevasse below, between C1 and C2. From C2 to C4 very steep and required fixed rope entire distance. 17th Oct summit attack by Ang Phurba, Baba and Kikuchi: started from C4 at 6 am; to 7800m easy climb because plenty of snow on rock and reached there at 12:15 pm; decided they should turned down because tired and Kikuchi planned to join 2nd attack party from C4 next day. Ang Phurba quickly reached C4 (1-1/2 hour). Baba probably reached traverse from C4, but now so cloudy no one there could see him; no fixed rope needed in easy couloir above C4. Kikuchi reached C4 10 mins after Baba was there and fell. 2nd attack party's Sherpas saw Baba falling below C4; he stopped falling near C2 near crevasse and was dead of broken head, etc. Now climbing stopped.


Tourism Ministry, 23 Oct 88

Mr Sinichi Baba, 1960, staff of Hare Co., Kiami Kokura Mihaki Saga of Japan, a climbing member of 11-member Nepal-Japan expedtion to Gyachungkang (7952m) reported to have slipped to death from 7300m on 17 October. He had started to climb to summit at 6 am that day but after reaching 7800m, turned back being very late and reaching near C4 at 7300m. Mr Baba slipped it is reported. Also reported, his body found near C2 (6300m) and his last rites completed there. Expedition being abandoned due to this accident. Leader of the expedition is Mr Uematsu Mitsuo, 1936, Fukuoka Hospital secretary.

Planned to go to SE Ridge but Swiss had its permit so interested in W Pillar and to do this acclimatize by going on normal route; also go to Makalu La to observe conditions. 13th Oct went to 6500m on normal route (normal C2) and pitched one tent as acclimatization camp and slept one night. 14th French-US team arrived and sent them off their route.

Up again on 21st and got to C2 at 8:00 pm, spent 3 hours digging out sleeping bags and took whole next day to dig out C2. 23rd up towards C3 in very deep snow and found avalanche had wiped all ropes on ice cliff and this last straw. Didn't have the equipment to fix new lines. Now 5 days of very high wind had come and not safe in cold and wind.

Did tests on viscosity of blood and changes that take place with altitude which shows blood definitely does thicken; tested drug that thins blood effectively.

Found G. O. Dyhrenfurth's ice axe and remains of his Sherpas who died in avalanche (pre-war clothing and small bones). 


Letter from Norman Dyhrenfurth - 25 Nov 1987

Chettan was crushed by a huge ice avalanche on May 8, 1930, and after more than an hour of artificial respiration he was buried near C2. My father's old ice-axe was indeed placed on his grave! Perhaps a recent avalanche brought his remains to the surface, and broke the ice axe as well. What a strong coincidence! I certainly look forward to receiving the two pieces. Knowing of no other climber climber killed at that place, it certainly must be Chettan.",Tremble and Brand-Maher altitude sickness,,Kunga (Nima),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2452981,

Marcel Ruedi & Oswald Oelz to Ross Munro, Time-life - 29 Sept 1986

That is what happened to Marcel Ruedi in March he was in third place in the world cup of 8000m peaks. He ws normal butcher, he led a regular life, trained, but had a normal family, everything, and just in his free time went to the 8000m peaks and that put him under pressure. Although he acclimatized very rapidly to altitude, this time it was too short. I mean, we left Zurich on the seventh of Sept on the 18th we were already at 7000m, and Marcel went to 7500m and that is just not enough time even for the best to acclimatize, We both felt sick and so we both went down to base camp. I still didn't feel good and I told Marcel, its too early for me. Marcel felt good after a short time and went with Wielicki (starting at 7700m) and they climbed to the summit (arriving there 4 pm, Sept 24). He was extremely strong and very very highly motivated. But I am sure that in the last stages of the ascent he developed severe, acute mountain sickness, particularly cerebral edema, which leads to bad judgement and things like that and that is why he bivouacked on the way down, at 8200m. (Wielicki descended to 7900m).

He survived the night... (on the morning of the 25th, Messner was at 7400m and saw Reudi moving slowly downwards, but later in day Messner saw no movement) but after that he had used up all his reserves and when (on Sept 25) Reinhold found him dead, he was at 7800m, (on a gently sloping plateau) and had some foamy blood coming out of his mouth, what is for me a sign of high altitude pulmonary edema.

Stone dead, he had bloody foam coming out of his mouth, which means for me that in the final stages he died of pulmonary edema. The problem on Makalu is that it's a long, long way back. Here was a guy who was so strong that you thought he could never be stopped. It was bad judgement, a bad idea.

(apparently the body was simply left where it lay)

He made sausages. He was an enthusiastic butcher, or charcutier. Ruedi was much stronger than me, he was an extremely strong man, but he did two and a half weeks after leaving Zurich, having climbed one of the highest peaks in the world this is by all means unreasonably, that is asking for trouble. He wanted to go to Makalu as quickly as possible so he could go to Everest and Lhotse. and then there would have been only two left.

25th: Messner reached Mak La at 9:00 am and saw Ruedi (descending). Later that day saw no movement and saw Ruedi dead on 26th between 7750m and 7800m. Ruedi apparently took foam from mouth which tells Oelz pulmonary edema. Body left where it was.

Recovered only few items there so descended, got more gear and made another dump at about same altitude in snow cave 20th Oct and descended immediately for rest before summit push. 23 Oct reached this place and found everything taken away by avalanche. Down again and to Ghunsa where met French Nepal Peak expedition who gave food and back up on 28th Oct.

About 31 Oct all 3 members reached 6900-7000m and during that night, when planned to go for summit, Eggerton's health deteriorated: was very tired, vomiting, crying out for oxygen and water, so had to take him down. Got to 6400m where Eggerton collapsed and died. ""We couldn't get him down fast enough"" - died on the ropes. Body impossible to carry down so swung it over steep crevassed area and sent it down into crevasses.


NZAC Bulletin (Don French) - March 1985

The expedition was called ""the Australian Army Jannu Expedition."" Terry Tremble, of Melbourne, was the leader with Keith Egerton, also of Melbourne, and myself as the team members. Jannu, also know as Kumbukarna, is a 7710m peak in eastern Nepal near Kangchenjunga. We each contributed approximately NZ$5000 (including flights) with the NZAC also contributing $300 to expenses. Fairydown (Australia) assisted Terry with clothing and a sleeping bag which he found excellent.

The approach consisted of eleven days walking of which only two could be considered to be ""leach days."" We used 22 porters all being paid Rs 34 per day (one trekking party was paying Rs 100 per day). Our base camp was established in the Yamatri valley on Sept 4 1986.

A total of three attempts were made on the mountain's southwest ridge (the original French route). The first was abandoned due to deteriorating weather. The second, with its superior weather, unfortunately ended when our dump, from the previous attempt, was found to be buried by an avalanche. The dump had contained our full supply of mountain food plus a few items clothing, ice hammers, stove and fuel and seventeen ""Mars Bars."" Fortunately we were able to intercept a passing French expedition in Ghunsa (a important village one days walk from base camp) who gave us enough mountain food for another attempt.

This attempt commenced on October 26th when we climbed to the C2 site. The following day we climbed through to our neve camp at 6000m. Col des Juenes was gained then continued up to Tete du Butoir, 6450m for our third night. We experienced a lot of cornicing on this day. The fourth day saw us climb over Tete de la Dentelle and onto the edge of a plateau known as the Throne. We were confined to camp for two days here due to high winds. During a lull I was able to climb to 7000m on the summit block to establish our high point. Unfortunately Keith became ill, so on November 1st we descended. Keith died from pulmonary edema after just a few hours of descent.

Keith's death was the thirteenth this autumn in the Nepal Himal. He was very well known in Australian climbing circles and by many New Zealanders who have visited the Arapiles. Keith was a member of the NZAC.

With alpine/lightweight style ascents in the Himalaya you might be able to get more trips to the dollar, but this is at the sacrifice of safety and success. One has to balance these sacrifices against cost and ethics. I doubt if our expedition would have had success if other techniques were employed. Unfortunately our earlier ventures onto the mountain were hampered by poor weather, so considerable time had to be spent at base camp waiting for the monsoon to pass.","Oct 31 all 3 members reached 6900-7000m & during that night, when planned to go for summit, Eggerton's health deteriorated (was very tired, vomiting, crying out for oxygen, water)",,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2452546,

There is no doubt Smith and Schleypen reached actual summit from Swiss team on 9th May considering where they were seen by this US etc expedition and time seen, and doubts expressed by Swiss members. Frush will write Smith for photo of him with Chinese flag.

Frush and Hambly did not see Everest and Lhotse because it was cloudy. We did go on beyond 1st bump in most interminable walk of my life taking 25 breaths per step to reach summit watched on 9 May, saw 1 man (or 2) from Woerner's expedition reach 1st bump on top of Cho Oyu early in morning and start down only 15-30 meters later. Woerner said Smith got to top of rock band, i.e., first bump, but Woerner hadn't reached that point - said 1st bump was good enough. Woerner's team claims were revised after Frush's claim to have been 1st American and Smith realized he could have been 1st American himself. At first Smith said he had no photos, then photos appeared but of different flags at different place.


Letter to Miss Hawley by Jim Frush - Sept 23, 1986

Enclosed are the photos I mentioned in my letter of August 23.

I hope that they resolve the question of who reached the true summit of Cho Oyu. The photos were taken two days apart in a period of relatively settled weather. There is no sign in our photos of the blue and white scarf that Jan Smith indicated he tied to the summit marker. It appears to me and others who have viewed the photos that they are of two different places. I have supplied the photos to Mr.Smith but have not received a reply.


Letter to Miss Hawley by Jim Frush - Aug 22, 1986

I wrote to Mr. Smith who replied he had no picture of himself on the summit.

Fortunately, he enclosed, however a slide that purported to show the summit marker. We were able to compare his slide to our photos and were pleased to discover that it appears, as proven by his own photo, that Mr. Smith reached only the false summit and not the true summit, located further back on the summit plateau. I'm having copies of the photos made and will forward a set to you within two weeks. And I have so notified Mr. Smith.

It appears necessary to get into this as Summit Magazine reported last week that Mr. Smith reached the summit. This report was submitted by Mike Cheney.

First tried to climb via S Face of Ngojumba and put a C1 at 6100m on 23 April and reached 6400m on 24th but then encountered chaos of seracs and crevasses which was very dangerous and decided to abandon this route (which French on Gyachung Kang actually did follow in lower part of their climb), requested change of route permit from HMG (got no answer) and went to Pole's route as above. Short direct route, technically more difficult than Tichy route but could be done by strong team without the 700m fixed rope put in by Poles. Very safe route without objective dangers and very beautiful ice ridges. On upper part was no snow this spring.

6 members left before climb entirely finished, but no reason for them to stay since summit teams were not supported from BC.

E Ridge appears equally difficult as Lhotse Shar. Lhotse traverse plus dangerous lower part of climb.

Frush claims first American ascent on May 11. Claims that Smith and Schleypen of W German/USA expedition did not reach true summit on May 9 (they only reached summit plateau).


Schleypen - 3 Nov 95

Confident he reached Cho Oyu's summit in 1986. Went to what surely was highest point of plateau (where there was pole with cloth, flags, as per Smith's photo), which took 30-45 minutes to reach from edge of plateau first reached - did not see Chinese metal flag (Frush's photo).


Habeler and Ruedi arrived BC on 21 April and 3 days later expedition decided 2000m fixed rope required for Ngojumba East Ridge to Cho Oyu plus 3 months time, so idea of trying this route abandoned and went to new route via 2 passes of 5700m to depot near Polish and US BC and did two ferries of loads (Habeler and Ruedi were first members to explore for new route). As for 1st time at depot on 28 Apr. 29 Apr went over Nangpa La and slept at Tichy camp near US. 2 May arrived at Poles ABC. 3 May Habeler and Ruedi left ABC to go as high as possible arriving at Poles C4 but a actually went to Poles C5 (Habeler and Ruedi C1) at 4:00 pm. 4 May stormy and very cold so all day in tent. 5 May left C1 7:30 am and on top 11:00 am. Stayed 1/2 hour in warm weather and very cloudy to south. Saw and photographed Chinese pole on summit ""with lady on it"" (hard to see pole on large summit plateau). Back in C1 1:00 pm, had tea and went on down. Nasty weather in which had trouble finding ridge to descend but continued to ABC at 7:00 pm.


Letter from Stefan Woerner to Miss Hawley, July 17,1986

What concerns Jan Smith's climb of Cho Oyu in my team last spring, I think there should be no doubt that he has been at the very top. Jan has sent me slides that can be only be taken from the top. One slide that I have not seen he has already sent to Jim Frush, showing the Chinese flag on the top. Please also receive a copy of the letter Jan Smith sent to Jim Frush in this matter.


Letter to Jim Frush from Jan Smith, June 21 1986

I reached the summit of Cho Oyu about midday on May 9th. But you'll have to take my word for it; I was on the summit alone. I'm not plugging Rolexes, so I didn't take any effort to photograph myself. I did photograph the summit marker and the view. Several transparencies are enclosed. One taken from the southern rim of the summit looks down on the area of our base-camp on the western edge of the Lungsampa Glacier. The blue silk scarf with white Chinese characters that you can see hanging from the summit marker is mine; I met my friend Rudiger Schleypen at the northern edge of the summit plateau; he continued on to the summit and I went on down to our camp where we spent the night. If it's important enough you should talk to Rudiger.

Above C1 was difficult rock peak with 4 rock steps; then down and traversed to middle of 3 peaks, then several snow peaks. Beyond C3 was 300m saddle but very sharp ridge here and very steep on both sides and above (=beyond) saddle, steep rock peak (5970m), followed by rock and snow peaks an fixed 3000m rope from point 5970m. 

Fixed total 3500m rope, even snow peaks very narrow and ridge all up and down. Planned total 4 high camps above ABC but sites very difficult (sides of ridge 45 degrees hard ice) and 2000m rope fixed rope needed.

Komprej hit by snow avalanche in 1st couloir but not serious. Constant snowfall meant camps on ridge covered by wind driven snow and ropes often covered by snow. Had only 4 days without snowfall and often had trouble seeing route when were in low clouds. Then last week of climbing strong winds. With no Sherpas with them, exhaustion setting in, in such weather would have taken this team another month to reach summit.

(a) around the bottom of the ridge which involves one ""difficult"" section on 
    which the Japanese fixed ropes, or 
(b) over a snowy part of the ridge which is straightforward but hard work.

Sors toes frostbitten badly. Ang Karma fell 70-80m near 2nd Step but not really hurt 12 Aug. Valles bad altitude sickness from summit (needed oxygen at ABC) and used discarded 1/2 bottle during descent to ABC.

Valles in KTM 16 Oct 1990 said 3 Spanish summiters did not use oxygen at all.

14 Spanish members but 1 was only BC Mgr after getting sick at ABC. Leader was Conrad Blanch. Ernic Lucas left early to return to his work before climbing finished.

Stayed away from ridge: jet stream used to roar off that ridge. Would have liked to go to it from technical point of view. Used just two 250-foot ropes in all the climb for fixing route.

Whole mountain was glistering in ice, rock hard. Very highest snowfall but fierce winds which stopped progress in 2nd half of Dec.

Chandler died of cerebral edema. Bremer-Kamp and Tamang serious frostbite of fingers and toes: Tamang should not have been taken so high and Bremer-Kamp's frostbite due to job of getting him down alive (she was taken because he was eager to go up and it was useful having another load carrier).


David Peterson

Bremer-Kamp had frostbite, will lose at least all fingers and parts of toes. She in hospital here, she ultimately requires surgery.

We were all set for the summit ""it was a gorgeous day."" 15th Chris didn't show any signs of call see. We came up from 24,000 ft camp and we carried rather late night before. At 6:00 made biv in cave at about 26,000. Was a horrible night - ""always is at that altitude."" Chris was melting all water and thus getting less oxygen than others. Next 8:00 am late start: Chris sitting, not putting on crampons, being real slow inside cave. Stove was on but not burning. Lethargic - felt better outside and said would feel better if he just lay down. She sat besides him for a while in cave and then needed go out; then started getting white splotches on nose and Chris said better go down.

Chris said its such good weather we could go for the summit. This was summit day. Chris: ""I can't see I'm going blind"" and Cherie losing peripheral vision herself. Cherie and Mangal tried to get him up and he couldn't walk. By time got his crampons and roped up it was 1:00 pm. We fell in bringing him down on his feet. Chris wrapped [?] himself several times. Got down about 1000 ft at about 5:30 pm and settled down for night in sleeping bag on 3 platforms in snow and Mangal to brew water for Chris, tried with ice-axe belay but slipped down slope a little. Got him back up but got restless, rolling over and standing up on 35 degree slope and would have have slid all the way. Chris said I need help and had his hand outside the bag and he stopped moving and thrashing about; ""used his lost little bit of energy.""

He wasn't breathing, died about 8 that night. Cheri's feet frozen several days before but ignored; hands froze in rescue. Mangal's hand became bad the night of 15th. As with Cherie, using bare hands next day to set Chris's body sitting up in a hole so he could see view, his pack beside him. Then left at about 8:00 am and moved very slowly down. Mangal wanted to die and kept sitting down, critically dehydrated and Cherie hallucinating coming down glacier on 19th.

Could have gone to top on 15th. Next 4 days weather was so good - we were so weak, just like kittens. ""Not allowed us to live - it just chose to take Chris."" ""The cerebral edema took me by surprise though I knew risks of such small party."" Took Mangal high in order to help got supplies up high and he keen to go high.

Would go back to him? If I could go back with Chris I would - next year.

Apparently they climbed the Middle Summit instead (see ANNM-844-01).

The leader of the French team, Bernard Muller, said that they saw the Korean summit team of one Korean woman and four Sherpas too far from the summit to have reached it at the time claimed. The Sherpas with the French were told by the Koreans' Sherpas that no one got to the top.

Dutch Rib and sickle were most difficult section of route: blue ice and much of route above C2 difficult with no snow, all ice, says Miss Kim. Ahn says they moved up quickly because same route as in 1983 autumn and same Sherpas on this route several times. Also weather good and autumn 1983 crevasse now not so big. C1 to C2 very easy. Only Miss Kim slept in C3, 3 other members carried loads here and slept in C2. From C3 to C4 again 3 other (excluding Ahn) only carried loads and return to C2.

Both fell from altitude 7800m at about 4:30 pm when Keepa not well balanced on hard ice was blown off balance by very strong wind, pulling Pasang Norbu with him and fell 700m. Could see bodies but not reach because very tired and bad wind which continued next days.

Miss Kim's face wounded by strong wind blowing ice after she took oxygen mask off when oxygen finished at summit. 2 Sherpas slightly hurt by avalanche.

Kim Young-Hwan - 21 Oct 85

HMG gave permission to Miss Kim to climb 6000m peak in Khumbu in 1985-6 winter but Korean Alpine Federation did not give their permission because of her apparent false claim to success on Annapurna I in 1984-5 winter.


Ang Temba - 12 March 85

Ang Temba (now going on Japanese expedition to Gurja-Dhaulagiri VI-Churen) was summiter on last winter's Korean Annapurna I expedition. They climbed to Middle Summit, which leader Ahn said was the highest summit. They could see another very close to them to the west and a third one to the east not so close. Ang Temba carried Miss Kim's oxygen bottles, she carried nothing. Sherpas used no oxygen; Miss Kim ""not so strong.""

Ang Temba again agreed with a sketch profile had summit middle peak. 


Bernard Muller, French Annapurna I leader - 27 Dec 84

Koreans: Saw them below summit at nearly time they said they on top. French Sherpas said Koreans not at top. Made summit photo at BC that was seen by French members there at BC. After success Muller and De la Ferriere saw them take 8 hours from C4 to highest point seen and 2 were hours at last from this point about 8000m to main summit. C4 was below middle summit. Muller wonders whether actually possible climb final route they said.

Koreans arrived BC about 18 or 19 Nov when French arrived C1 they had C3 established and before 1 Dec had climbed icefall below C4 and made C4 28 or 29 Nov. This is not a winter ascent.


South Korean Annapurna I expedition - Winter 1984:

Members Ahn and Miss Kim Young-Ja said on 17 Dec 84, after their team had returned to Kathmandu, that Miss Kim and four Sherpas had reached the summit on 7 Dec. (Two of these Sherpas fell to their deaths during descent.)

A surviving Sherpa, Ang Temba agreed on 12 March 85 and again on 30 May 00 that they had gone to the middle summit. (He agreed both times with a sketch profile of the summit ridge that it was the middle one way they had climbed). He said in 1985 that from their summit they could see a summit very near them to the west and another not so close to the east. The leader had told that the middle summit was the highest, so they went to it and then descended.

The leader of a French expedition also on the north side, Bernard Muller, said in December 1984 that they were not convinced that the Koreans team had actually reached the summit. The French saw the Korean summit party through binoculars on 7 Dec at a spot below and well to the east of the main summit quite near the time the Koreans later reported their summit party had been to the top. The Koreans had taken eight hours from their camp four to this point, and the French estimated that it would have taken the summit party at least two more hours to get to the main summit in the very strong winds that were blowing. Some French men who were at base camp after 7 Dec watched the Korean summiter and four Sherpas pose very near base for a ""summit photo.""",Miss Kim's Face wounded by strong wind; 2 Sherpas slightly hurt by avalanche,1st Korean and Nepal ascent; 1st winter ascent; Miss Kim 1st woman to 8000m summit,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,2451761,
